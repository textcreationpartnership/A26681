            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101327:5"/>a particular Church may excommunicate, or (if it be) let the Learned diſpute it. The onely queſtion is, whether M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> and his Church have walked by the rule of Chriſt, in the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that Cenſure to theſe perſons; And this I deny, and ſay, there were no crimes proved that might argue the parties guilty, or deſerving ſuch a Cenſure, in the judgement of any impartial and underſtanding men; and their unblamable walkings before, and ſince, may juſtly challenge M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley,</hi> and his Church to anſwer what they have done, before the Tribunal of him, who ſhall judge the VVorld in righteouſneſſe. For this I appeal to all that ſhall be pleaſed to exerciſe their patience in peruſing the following <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> together with thoſe ſhort obſervations that I have made upon ſuch ſad paſſages in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleys</hi> Sermon, as have an odious reflection upon the cenſured parties beyond all truth and reaſon. I ſhall no longer detain the Reader, but onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to conſider impartially of what is here offered and judge accordingly.</p>

            <head>THE NARRATIVE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout the year 1648. the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt, being all of them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mark Downe</hi> in his Church at <hi>Exeter,</hi> I, and my wife conſidering with our ſelves, that for the ſpace of two or three years then laſt paſt, we had not partak't of the Lords Supper, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to partake thereof, we thought it our duty to endeavour to be admitted to joyn with that Church in that Ordinance, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made our addreſſes, we were (after exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination) admitted, and did partake in all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances with them.</p>
            <p>About two years after, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Stucley</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to gather a Church in <hi>Exeter</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational way, A friend of ours, telling us what purity of Ordinances and excellent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations they had amongſt them, even to admiration, And deſiring me to ride to <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deford</hi> to behold the Goſpel-order they had in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>VVilliam Bartlets</hi> Church there, and the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101327:6"/>excellent manner of adminiſtration of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances by him, we being by this great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of purer ordinances and adminiſtrations, rapt up into a fools paradiſe, forthwith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired our friend to propoſe us to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> congregation for our reception, which he did accordingly, And upon notice from him at the day appointed, we preſented our ſelves at their meeting; And (being deſired) we ſpake our experiences, and ſo were diſmiſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till another time, when we were ſent for by them, and accordingly came, and were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and continued in fellowſhip with them about four years; After which time du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our ſaid fellowſhip: There was a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the name of the Church, brought to my houſe for me to ſign, The ſubſtance of which was to pray the <hi>Lord Protector</hi> not to accept of the Kingly Office, And it was ſaid, there was a clauſe in it, to pray the <hi>Lord Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> to diſſolve the Parliament. Whereupon I told the party that brought it, That the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were wiſe enough for ſtate-affairs, with which they were intruſted, And for me, or any private perſon, to medle with ſuch great matters, were very fooliſhneſſe, and ſo refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſign it; The party that brought this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition told me, that it was to be ſigned onely by ſeven of the Church in the name of the whole; And accordingly it was ſigned by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101327:6"/>ſome few of the Church, and ſent up, others of the Church not knowing thereof, untill the rumor thereof was ſpread about the whole City, The which my wife obſerving, ſaid, This is no fair dealing, and deſired me to be wary what I did. This being the firſt diſreliſh my wife had of their proceedings, it was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by a friend that came to my houſe, who asked me whether I had ſigned the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Church had ſent up? To whom I anſwered, I had not, he replyed I am glad with all my heart you did not, for (ſaid he) there is that in the Petition for which ſome eminent Stateſ-men have loſt their heads, and ſaid, It was judged by the long Parliament to be Treaſon for any one to Counſel or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the King to diſſolve the Parliament, as you may ſee in the Caſes of the Archbiſhop, and Strafford. My wife hearing this diſcourſe, her heart began to grow, and could not but vent her ſelf a little, ſaying, that ſhe feared the Church carried on ſome particular mans inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and begged me I would be exceeding wary what I did, and have reſpect to my ſelf, her, and our children; But yet (as to the Church was very quiet) the next time that we went to the Church-meeting, was a day of prayer; At which time, one amongſt the reſt prayed much after the rate of the Petition; And had this paſſage concerning the <hi>Lord
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101327:7"/>Protector:</hi> Lord humble him, what would he have? Is he not high enough already? And a great deal more of ſuch ſtuff, when I and my wife came home, ſhe asked me how I like thoſe paſſages, and ſaid me thinks it is like M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Feaks</hi> praying; I anſwered her, and ſaid, If he pray ſo again, I will never hear him more: Hereupon my wife began to flagg in her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards their way, and now every thing that was amiſſe began to be thought on by her, and in particular, the expreſſions of ſome of their members, who, in making out their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences at their admiſſions, ſpake of ſuch ſins as are not to be named, which thing ſhe ſaid bordered too nigh Auricular confeſſion.</p>
            <p>The next time my wife went to the meeting, was a day appointed by the Church for thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, for that God was pleaſed to prevent ſome inſurrection by the fift-Monarchy-men, &amp; for that the <hi>Lord Protector</hi> would not accept the Kingly office, when ſhe had waited long at the place, the people were diſmiſt without doing any thing for that time, for that the <hi>Lord Protector</hi> had then given but his firſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative anſwer. My wife returned home much diſcontented that I had not told her the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that days meeting before ſhe went, and ſaid, that for her part, ſhe apprehended that ſome of them did carry on a ſelfiſh carnal deſign.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:101327:7"/>
            <p> After this there was a Covenant brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, to be debated in order to the taking there of, and all or a great part thereof was aſſented unto by them; but my wife ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Copy thereof from the Elder, ſhe utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſlik't it, eſpecially, two perticulars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; The one whereof was a Tying of them up wholy to hear them when they preach't, and no other without their leave; and the other was, that we were to exſpect a greater bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from God on their Miniſtry then any others.</p>
            <p>All theſe particulars being laid together made ſuch impreſſions on her thoughts, that ſhe reſolved, not to joyn any longer with them on ſuch termes, or in the manner as formerly, But forthwith went and joyned her ſelf to <hi>Mr. Marke Downes</hi> Church from whence ſhe formerly departed, profeſſing her hearty ſorrow for her departure thence, and ſaying, ſhe was perſwaded the Lord had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his diſpleaſure againſt her for the ſame, which ſhe apprehended by reaſon of thoſe many viſitations on herſelf, and the death of her children; The Thurſday next before the Sacrament at <hi>Mr. Stucleys</hi> Church, I did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding deſire her to go with me to the meeting in way of preparation thereunto, but ſhe refuſed, alleadging the reaſons before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; whereupon one of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101327:8"/>that was likewiſe abſent from the meeting, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my wife at work in her porch, asked her, what was the reaſon that ſhe was not at the meeting; ſhe anſwered, I think I ſhall not come there any more, thereupon he asked her, ſaying, why then did you come among us, you may go among the Presbyterians to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Forde,</hi> who is for general admiſſion, as (ſaid he) he declared, at the laſt general meeting of the Miniſters in <hi>Exeter:</hi> hereupon my wife deſired me to go with her to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Forde,</hi> which I did, and ſhe asked of him, whether he did ever declare himſelf to be for general admiſſion to the Lords Supper, who anſwered, he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of that opinion, and whoſoever ſaid that he was, did much wrong him. This traducing of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Forde,</hi> and their common ſlighting of others, that are not of their way (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo godly) helped to heighten her diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>Within few dayes after came one (now an Elder of their Church) to admoniſh my wife for not coming to their private meetings; To whome ſhe anſwered, ſhe intended to come no more amonſt them; for that there was ſuch kind of praying and carrying on deſigns, that ſhe could no way cloſe with, and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to me for the farther knowledge of her mind: ſhortly after he brings with him one more, and after that others came, but ſhe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101327:8"/>would give them no other anſwer then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, nor admit of any other private diſcourſe, with them (remembring how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Parr</hi> was entangled by them) unleſs they would admit two perſons, whom ſhe ſhould appoint to hear their diſcourſe; This would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be granted, pretending, that no others were to have to do with the buſines of their Church, which I look upon as a dangerous principle; but at length they conſented; and when both parties met together; They were asked what they had to lay to her charge, who anſwered to this effect, that they charged her for going from their Church; which they ſaid was Schiſme, and no other thing had they to charge her withall; to whom the other party anſwered, ſaying, you are the Schiſmaticks in rending from other Churches, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cawdries Book</hi> to prove the ſame; which was all the ſubſtance of the debate at that meeting. Shortly after this, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> deſires to ſpeak with my wife, who ſent him word that ſhe would not come to him ſingle or alone, but if he &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mall</hi> pleaſed to meet two other Miniſters with her, that ſhe ſhould nominate, ſhe would ſubmit to their joynt determination: But this was utterly refuſed by him; although it was offered him again &amp; again. After the former Admonition by thoſe of the Church, I my ſelf uſed arguments to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101327:9"/>perſwade her to return to Maſter <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church; preſſing them with ſo much eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and harſhneſſe, that I have cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for ſtrayning the ſtrings ſo high, that it brake out into ſome words of heat, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content; but at length, I and my wife accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have the Caſe juſtly ſtated, whether thoſe things before mentioned, at which ſhe was ſo much offended, were ſufficient cauſe to withdraw from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church, and go to another. Now where to find fit perſons for the reſolving of this queſtion, we knew not for the preſent, being both of us tender to engage the Miniſters of this City, leaſt it might prove of ill conſequence, or beget ſome Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity between them upon the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the queſtion; and therefore we mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed to go to <hi>Taunton;</hi> where we thought we might be well ſatisfied by ſome friends there, without more ado; the time for our journey was prefixt and the day came, but a friend that was to accompany us, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon ſome publick buſineſſe, our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was put off, and no other day appointed; My wife having waited about ten days longer, and I too often preſſing arguments againſt her withdrawing from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church, ſhe became impatient of farther delay, &amp; told me that ſhe would go ſomewhere to be reſolved, and riſing early in the morning, having given
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101327:9"/>a charge to her chiefeſt Servant-maid to be carefull of her children untill her return, ſhe went away, but whether ſhe went I knew not for the preſent, which exceedingly troubled me; I then apprehending the ill uſe would be made thereof. Towards the evening of the ſame day I underſtood that my wife was gone to <hi>Honiton,</hi> whether I rode that evening unto her, and we lodged there that night in a very friendly manner, and the next morning when I awaked, asking her whether ſhe intended her journey, ſhe told me that I had too long delayed her, and that ſhe was now reſolved for <hi>Taunton</hi> to her friends, to be ſatisfied about the former queſtion; and for that purpoſe had ſent to a Kinſman of ours in <hi>Somerſet,</hi> to bring my Mare, which he there kept, and furniture with him to <hi>Honiton,</hi> to carry her to <hi>Taunton;</hi> which was brought that morning according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; And I had then a great mind to have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her thither, but our friend with us, having urgent occaſions to return to <hi>Exeter,</hi> we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly came home together with him; reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon another journey thither afterwards; which we undertook accordingly. But failed of that full fatisfaction we expected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cley</hi> having been there with our friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, and (as I have cauſe to ſuſpect) had tampered with them about our buſines; Shortly after we were returned from <hi>Honiton,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:101327:10"/>I remembred my wife of her failing or miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in not acquainting me with her journey, who anſwered (with tears) that ſhe was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the evil thereof, but intended no harm thereby, and deſired the Lord to humble her, and forgive her for it, and prayed me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give her, which I did with all my heart.</p>
            <p>Now, Reader, I have given thee the true and impartial ſtate and ſtory of the occaſion, manner &amp; end of my wifes going to <hi>Honiton,</hi> which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> hath repreſented by a falſe perſpective, or multiplying-glaſſe, and moſt unworthily terms, running away from her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; whereof ſhe never had the leaſt thought. Behold, and wonder, this is her capital crime, that he paralels with inceſt, This (by his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) is a ſin unpardonable by a husband, without his Churches ſatisfaction: But (that I may not digreſſe, but go on with the ſtory) take notice, that his Church (poor ſouls) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſt &amp; bemiſted with prejudice, though they knew neither the occaſion, nor end of her journey, they too gladly take advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and hereupon two others of his Church were ſent to my wife, with whom ſhe refuſed conference, unleſſe upon the terms before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and began to be very rough with them; telling them, that they ſhould forbear her houſe, for that ſhe apprehended they did ſet her husband at variance with her, ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101327:10"/>ſeen a letter of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Savery,</hi> one of their members, written unto me, carrying ſo much (if not more) in the ſenſe thereof; and ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving likewiſe heard the expreſſion of another member of theirs, who, ſpeaking concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my wife; ſaid unto me, if the unbeliever depart, let her depart: After this M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley,</hi> with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mall,</hi> pretended they had a mind to treat with two other Miniſters (but ſuch as themſelves ſhould nominate) about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, whereupon my wife propoſed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Forde</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mark Downe</hi> to treat with them, both of which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> refuſed, ſaying, he had burnt his fingers with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Forde</hi> already, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Downe</hi> was an Ingaged or a prejudie'd man. So that propoſal took no effect: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon reports were brinted, by ſeveral of the members of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church; That they had an intent to proceed againſt my wife, by way of excommunication, whereat I took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to abſtain from their private meetings, at which they were much offended, and ſent to me, to come to the Church, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned me to write them this following letter in anſwer, which I thought good here to inſert at large, that the Reader may ſee the truth of what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> ſayes, that I never did or ſaid any thing to prevent it.</p>

                     <hi>CHriſtian friends, The occaſion of my writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you is this, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Rolls <hi>and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh <hi>were with me yeſterday, deſiring me to come to your meeting this day, which I was minded to do, but conſidering with my ſelf, what was beſt to be done, I choſe rather to write becauſe of my unfitneſſe to ſpeake, eſpecially before ſome, who have already much defamed me, as to make me a perjur'd man; And why? Becauſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Mark Down <hi>baptized my child, other defamations there have been, but I ſpare, and forgive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their asking me mercy, If you deſire a reaſon of my forbearance of your company, It is this, when my wife and you differed, I could ſeldom meet with any of you, but a little after ſalute, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the diſcourſe was about my wife, in which I could take no felicity, it being but as vineger or gravel to my teeth, eſpecially the ſaying of one, If the unbeliever depart, let her depart, This and ſuch like ſayings begat in me ſome diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which, for want of better obſervation, I thought zeal, which, when my good father heard
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101327:11"/>of, I remember his adviſe was this, next to peace with God, and your own conſcience, which is the effect of the former, preſerve peace in your family, eſpecially with your wife, which I have done, and ſhall maintain, and if any be offended thereat, let them be offended, although you be very dear unto me ſtill, for whom I ſuffer daily; As for my abſence from your private meetings, to me it ſeems unreaſonable any one ſhould aske a reaſon thereof, you know what debates and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes you have had about my wife, and how diſagreeing to a husbands affection would it have been, if I ſhould have been there, eſpecially, being of another apprehenſion as to that thing, then you were, for I perceive after long and ſerious conſideration, that the first ground of my wifes distaste with you, was her earnest love to me, fearing ſome evil might happen as to my life, or eſtate by joyning with you in a Petition you ſent up to my</hi> Lord Protector, <hi>which was occaſioned thus: There was a man of good underſtanding came to viſite me, Amongſt the reſt of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he asked me whether I had ſigned the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the Church ſent up, I anſwered, no; He replyed, I am glad with all my heart you did not, for there is that in it, for which ſome eminent States-men have loſt their lives, And that was for ſeeking to diſſolve the Parliament, which my wife hearing deſired me I would have a care. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wards other things followed, which increaſed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101327:12"/>this diſſatisfaction; and truly made me to ſtagger; Such things as theſe (indeed) are the onely way to break and Ruine the Church; Beſides this, how am I perplext to hear daily the Scoffs and Taunts wherewith ſome of our brethren have every where at their doores, and ſhops, and tables vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her, for whom I am to leave father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For my Forbearance of the Lords Table, I have (I confeſſe deſired to be humbled for it) ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained too long, too long. But you know who is unſatisfied with me</hi> (Thomas Savery) <hi>and as I ſuppoſe, can hardly ſit with me, And as to the other Churches of Chriſt here, I have forborn in part to partake with them, becauſe I would not offend you; But having well conſulted with thoſe more wiſe and godly then my ſelf, I have taken up this reſolution to ſeek the Lord to prepare me to partake with both, as occaſion offers; and I ſhall endeavour to wipe off (what I can) that ill name, which I fear is too juſtly laid on us (ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts.) Now, I ſhall deſire you to ſend me word, whether I ſhall meet you at the Lords Table the next time, that I may diſpoſe of my ſelf according as I ſhall hear from you, &amp; If you have any thing to offer me in writing, I ſhall kindly receive it, and return you anſwer with all humility; praying dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for you all, I recommend you to God, &amp; remain,</hi>

Lord, O that God would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for them, fetch them away thence, Lord, there-hence, Lord, if they belong unto thee, fetch them back again, Lord, back again. O let them not reſt there, O let them have no quiet

And now it is given, the Lord ſecond it upon them, that they may know, that we have not done it in a revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way, give them to underſtand that we have wiſhed well to their ſouls to day, and that we had not ſet upon this work, but that we know not how to anſwer the contrary, we know not how to anſwer the neglect thereof one day longer, and therefore we delivered them up, that their ſouls may be ſaved in the day of Chriſt, we beſeech thee that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt make them know, that they are under the curſe of God; Let them know that they are gone out of this place accurſed; O let them know that all their prayers, are accurſed pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? and all the bread they preſume to eat is accurſed bread to them: And let them know, that their eſtates and priviledges are accurſed to them, and that if they live and die in their ſin, they are accurſed for ever; Awaken them throughly, O Lord; would to God they had beene here to day, but they are gone with the curſe of God at their heels, all their company will be accurſed company to them, and we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101327:16"/>can ſee them no more; we may not go unto their houſes any day more, we may not come near them, as in the daies of old. O Lord, That they might be aſhamed, let them be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, They have foreheads of braſſe, but O that they might be aſhamed; O Lord, how glad would we be to ſee theſe poore worms crawling to this houſe another day; ſurely, there is that upon their backs that they will not get off, till they repent; there is that upon them will damn them, unleſſe they return, there is that upon them will coſt them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal flames, unleſſe they return.

They have deceived him (as he ſaith,) But the truth is they were deceived in him, and his Church, expecting when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into fellowſhip with them, that purity which they never found, And now when they were diſappointed, and ſo apprehended
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101327:20"/>their over-ſight, and went about to mend their fault, by returning to thoſe congregations to which they formerly belonged, he judgeth them cauſeleſly.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 10. <hi>He calls my wife a Lawleſs woman, that knows no ſubjection,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I cannot forbear to ſay, this is a moſt notorious belying her, whom I know to be far otherwiſe, I have cauſe to bleſſe God for ſo good and obedient a wife, and one that orders the affairs of my family and calling, with ſo much care and diligence as my heart can wiſh: Inſomuch that I have often left the whole management of my trade and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on her head &amp; care, for a whole moneth together, in my abſence, when I have kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 500. people on work; For what he charges her, about her going once to <hi>Honi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> I have ſufficiently anſwered in the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> to which I refer the Reader.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 10. <hi>Again, Theſe have turned their backs on pure ordinances,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> As if no pure ordinances could be found, but in <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Stucleys</hi> Church, or ſome other of the ſame edition. Reader, be pleaſed to take notice, They were in actual commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the reſt of Gods people in this City, before they were excommunicated, And therefore did not turn their backs on pure ordinances; but ſuch is the pride of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101327:21"/>they think there are no pure ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances but in their own Churches.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 12. The like ſtuff you have page 12. That now my wife and M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parr</hi> are not in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church, they are not amongſt Gods people, Cannot enjoy the benefit of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, See in what a ſad condition all are, that are not Independents.

But for that which he ſo much commends, I do aſſure thee, neither I, nor my wife could ever ſee ſuch eminency of godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their converſations, I ſhall not aſperſe them, I will onely ſay, I know many, very many no Independents in this City, of as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable and godly converſation as any of them, And my wife may ſee the converſation of thoſe (I hope) notwithſtanding ſhe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley,</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p> Pag. 14. I have no mind to diſcant upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> fancy, in the fourteenth page, where he frames a parly between God and the Divel 'tis abſurd enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Onely I muſt ſay, he hath again ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred my wife, In ſaying ſhe hath removed the bounds, and that ſhe is a Lawleſſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; The contrary to my knowledg is moſt true, and for this there are in this City as many godly Chriſtians to witneſſe, as far exceed the number of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church. I know it is a ſad thing to be juſtly excommunicated, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. But I know many have been excommunicated by the Pope, and ſome by the Phariſees, The queſtion is whether thoſe perſons were juſtly excommunicated? And that I deny, And leave it to the Impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Judge by the <hi>Narrative.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. 15. He cites M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Grenhams</hi> opinion of excommunication. <hi>They are among Zijms and Iijms,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> He need not cite M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Grenhams</hi> opinion to perſwade me or my wife, what a ſad thing excommunication is. I only ſay the curſe that's cauſleſs, ſhal not come: The Popes Bull is but a beaſt, when it roars the loudeſt.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 17. Whereas contumacy is urged as the reaſon of excommunication, and <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> is quoted, with a ſufficient ſlur upon him and the Presbyterians.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:101327:22"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I Reply that cannot be contumacie, For that one act of indiſcretion ſhe hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to my ſelf; And (if an errour) 'twas ſuch (I hope) as was pardonable by the husband, without <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Stucleys</hi> indulgence. There was no perſiſting in any crime, but onely her not coming to <hi>Mr. Stucleys</hi> Church, And <hi>Mr. Stucley</hi> cannot but remember the many overtures ſhe made, for a meeting of him and <hi>Mr. Mall,</hi> with other Miniſters, and her willingneſſe to ſubmit to their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he refuſed, as if he had been Lord Biſhop Paramont, and his Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, for which I refer you to the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi> But now (for-ſooth,) Contumacie muſt be the foil to ſet off the fact, and a decoy to draw the Church, into this unwarrantable practice.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 19. My wife is accuſed for <hi>neglecting fellowſhip, and covenant breaking, and running away,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer ſhe holds fellowſhip with the people of God, And for covenant breaking, ſhe is ſo far guilty, as ſhe was no more willing to be confined to Maſter <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church, but indeed, of her own accord went from it, for reaſons mentioned in the <hi>Narrative</hi> before.</p>
                  <p>If ſhe had made a covenant (which yet ſhe never intended) to walk with Maſter <hi>Stucleys</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:101327:22"/>Church, and not with other people of God, It is an unlawfull covenant, and ſo better bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken then kept.</p>
                  <p>For her pretended ſcandalous running from me, I have given a ſatisfactory anſwer in the <hi>Narrative</hi> by which the Reader may judge what a ſcandalous abuſing her it is, to charge her with deſerting her husband, and family, when in mine own conſcience, I know the contrary, and that ſhe never entertained the leaſt thought of it, And except Maſter <hi>Stucley,</hi> and his Church, there is not one ſober man that knows her, ever ſaw cauſe to ſuſpect her of ſuch an unnaturall act. She continueth to dwell with me as a dutiful and obedient wife, ſhe never ran from me, but onely went as far as <hi>Huniton</hi> with a purpoſe to go as far as <hi>Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> There to intreat the adviſe and aſſiſtance of ſome near relations for ſatisfaction touching thoſe differences, occaſioned upon her deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Church.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 19. <hi>Whereas he charges her with her companion, whom he ſets off with a daſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer that the woman hath been her keeper for many years in child-bed, as ſhe was of many other women of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and quality in this City, and was my wifes keeper (when in child bed) all the time ſhe was in Mr. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church, and yet then no exception againſt her; Beſides ſhe being a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101327:23"/>midwife, was a fit companion for my wife then great with child, for what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> hints, and ſome of his members have ſaid of that woman, I am perſwaded they can never prove it, but do very much abuſe and ſlander her therein.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 19.20. <hi>When M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Stucley <hi>preſſes</hi> Tit. 2.5. <hi>Know Reader that he hath omitted ſomewhat that he ſpake in preaching to inſinuate into his Auditory a ſuſpition of my wifes chastity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he did moſt unworthily abuſe her.

                  <p>That which followes is to the ſame Tune, All that I will ſay is, that it is clean contrary, ſhe never look't on me as a <hi>Nabal,</hi> but hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhewed me as much tendernes; and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate kindeneſſe as my heart could wiſh; ſhe never left her truſt, otherwiſe then any good houſewife muſt do, when ſhe is forc't to be from home, ſhe went out in a journey, which ſhe intended to diſpatch with all ſpeed, &amp; then to return again to her family; of whom ſhe gave a ſpecial charge to her chiefeſt maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant at her going abroad: How ſcandalous
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101327:23"/>a report have they made of what had nothing blamable but a little indiſcretion in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, and of this ſhe was preſently ſenſible, and cryed me mercy.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 20.21. For M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parr</hi> who is charged with lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may ſee by what is ſaid in the end of the 20. page, ſhe was not well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the proceedings of Maſter <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church, and for that let her anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Onely this I can ſay, ſhe was look't on by them as a pretious ſoul, till ſhe had a mind to hear ſome other Miniſters, and here began the quarrel which could not be ended but in her Excommunication, becauſe ſhe was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie in her reſolution, not to be tyed from hearing of others; how far ſhe might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her ſelf in diſcourſe with them, which they call tripping in her tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I cannot ſay, onely (if ſhe did) it was partly occaſioned by their tampering with her, for going out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to hear ſome other Miniſters of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in which ſhe was ſo reſolved, as ſhe choſe to leave Mr. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church, and ſo did, and was in communion with other Churches in this City for a long time before they excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated her.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 21. He ſaith, for my Wifes coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, <hi>it was ſomewhat obſervable,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> It is obſervable indeed how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cley</hi> perſiſts in his unworthy deſign and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101327:24"/>to ſlur and vilifie her, whom (whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver malice ſaies) I have cauſe to ſay to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of grace, <hi>God</hi> hath bleſt with ſome good meaſure of knowledge of him and his will, and of her ſelf, and her duty, which ſhe hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the general courſe of her converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (the beſt character of a Chriſtian) as all that know her, can bear her witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 21. And whereas in the ſame page, he charges her for <hi>omiſsion of the Church-duties of admonition, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Note, what a good ſhepherd M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cley</hi> is, that in the whole ſpace of about 4. years, whilſt ſhe was of his Church, he could never ſpie this fault, ſo as to reprove her for it, till ſhe had left his Church, and then he can find it in his heart to curſe her for it.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 21.22. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> tells another ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but very partially and untruly, charging my Wife with abuſing her ſiſter, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> The truth of the ſtory is this: About four years ſince, I obſerving my brother not to thrive in his way of husbandry, which he then uſed, out of my affection to him, and care of his good, I ſet him in a way of Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, wherein neither he, nor his wife, having any inſight, I gave them all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and aſſiſtance I could, both by my advice and inſtruction therein, and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him mine own ſervants of all ſorts, to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101327:24"/>carry on his work, and took off all the ſerges he made, and ſold them at the ſame prizes with mine own, which otherwiſe he could not poſſibly advance to that rate, and my Wife being alſo very loving to him, and his Wiſe, her ſiſter in Law, and deſiring their good, and thriving in their Trade, and knowing their gains, ad obſerving her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in Law not to be ſo careful and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as ſhe ſhould be, and as that Trade re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and their expenſes riſing ſomewhat high, ſhe adviſed her ſaid ſiſter, to have a care that they did not ſpend more then they got, whereat her ſiſter took great diſtaſte, but ſhewed no more care then formerlie, my Wife fearing their going back in Trade, when ſhe went up into the Eaſtern parts, wiſhed her ſiſters mother to give her the like advice as ſhe had done, which, I apprehended ſhe did, and her ſaid ſiſter being much offended as it, inſtead of imbracing this counſel, which would have done her no hurt, ſhe complains to ſeveral of the members of Maſter <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church, and had engaged a ſtrong partie for her, before my Wife knew thereof, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it came to a hearing before Maſter <hi>Stucley,</hi> and by his means they were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and in token thereof, kiſſed each other, and afterwards frequented each others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in a very friendly manner, at the Lords
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101327:25"/>Table, and their own Tables, upon occaſion, for the ſpace of above a year together, even untill the time of my Wifes withdrawing from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>Reader, judge how fit it is for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> to rake up this petty buſineſſe, an offence indeed taken and not given, and to aggravate it in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit and print beyond all truth, near three years after they had been reconciled, and the ſame had been buried in oblivion, of purpoſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatter and abuſe my Wife; But I wonder not at it, when I conſider how ſuitable it is, to what himſelf once told me upon occaſion of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Letter to M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parr,</hi> That when he wrote Letters of that nature, he would have as much of reflection in them, as he could, that they might be aſhamed to ſhew them.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 23. My wife (I can truly ſay) puts a great price upon all Gods Ordinances, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular on excommunication; ſhe is not ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as not to know the conſequence of it, onely ſhe might perhaps ſpeak ſlightly of their excommunicating her, when they threatned her with it, as a man may ſlight the Popes Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication without any prejudice to Gods Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 23. Whereas M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley.</hi> pag. 23. in his comparing her ſin, with the ſin of the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous perſon, ſaith, <hi>The inceſtuous perſon did not ſeparate from the Church to avoid the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but ſo have theſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:101327:25"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Reader, take notice of a groſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth: How can it be ſaid, that my Wife ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Church to avoid the cenſure, whereas, (themſelves being judges) they had nothing to cenſure her for, before ſhe left them, they never ſo much as pretended any cauſe or ground for a cenſure untill ſhe had deſerted them, and long after, although they moſt unworthily ſifted my late domeſtick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to find ſomewhat to accuſe her of, but could find none. Note, the pretended crime or cauſe of Excommunicating her, was in time, long after ſhe had left M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church; when ſhe left M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church ſhe had done nothing in the leaſt that might incurre a Church-cenſure, &amp; therefore it could not be rationally imagined, that ſhe ſhould deſert the Church to avoid a Church-cenſure. To this I ſay no more, but lyars need good memories.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For their perjury, Covenant-breaking, and ſchiſm which are charged on them,</hi> in pag. 23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I confeſſe they have relinquiſhed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church, and thats their fault, and yet I dare aſſure you, my Wife had not done this had they not meddled with ſtate affairs, and had M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> and his Church allowed her to communicate in the Ordinances with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, as there was occaſion: They held it their ſin to be tied to one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101327:26"/>and to be debarred fellowſhip with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially there being ſo many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of it in this place.</p>
                  <p>Whereas in the application, pag. 24. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> charges other churches and Miniſters for want of diſcipline; I ſhall leave it to thoſe Miniſters to vindicate their own practice: I do not pretend to ſo much knowledge and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as to meddle at all with it, onely I wiſh, that they were all free from lying, that Maſter <hi>Stucley</hi> gives the Sacrament unto in his Church, I know none thats offended at their exerciſe of diſcipline, onely I, and many others think we have cauſe to be offended at theſe their procedings, becauſe we know as bad tollerated amongſt them, and nothing ſaid to them, becauſe they have a mind to ſtay with them, which theſe poor women had not; Alaſſe (poor ſouls) that they muſt needs fall into thoſe foul faults, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley,</hi> and his Church can by no means brook or endure.</p>
                  <p>For this third uſe of Information, pag. 27. we deſire to apply it for the comfort of theſe poor oppreſſed and deſpiſed women; made as the Scum and off-ſcouring of all things, by his and his Churches abuſing of Gods holy Ordinance, hoping the wiſe diſpoſer of all things will order it to their ſpiritual advantage, by giving them grace to cleave to God, when they are caſt off by men, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101327:26"/>to hold communion with others of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to better purpoſe now they are excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by them. Once we are ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that they may be caſt out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleys</hi> Church, and yet be in the readier way to heaven.</p>
                  <p>For the laſt uſe of Exhortation, I muſt needs ſay it is very proper for himſelf &amp; his Church, I wiſh them to take it home to themſelves, they have need enough of it, tis very true, as he ſaith <hi>The leaven is among them, the leaven of the Phariſees,</hi> &amp;c. There are none that know them, but are too well acquainted with their great thoughts they have of themſelves, as the onely Church and people of God in <hi>Exon,</hi> and what other Churches have been called and counted by them, That God will in due time diſcover the hypocriſie of lyars I know well, and that God would bring to light their proceedings is my hearty deſire and prayer; I pray too, that their may be no more lyars found amongſt them then their are as yet, nor any that are diſobedient; for my Wife, I know ſhe hath kept her bounds at home ſo well, as I deſire nothing more then her perſeverance in that obedience and duty ſhe hath yielded me hitherto.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101327:27"/>conſider, how the whole drift of his diſcourſe, which was a kind of Sermon on that ſad and black day, aims at this, that they onely are Zion, and the Iſrael of God, and all others as bad as the ſtrangers, from whom Iſrael ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in <hi>Nehemians</hi> time.</p>
            <p>For thir renewing their Covenant that day; I wiſh they have done it heartily, and remember what they are bound to by their Covenant in Baptiſm, <hi>(viz.)</hi> To forſake the Devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, and the carnal deſires of the fleſh, ſo as not to be led by them. So I ſay, Amen.</p>

            <p>UPon first view of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Pamphlet called (Manifeſt Truth) as I could not but wonder, ſo I could not caſily reſolve, whether his pride and arrogance, or his paſsion and impudence were moſt predominant, each appearing at ſuch a magnitude, which at firſt made me think that as it deſerved, ſo it needed, no other anſwer but ſilence, which (as the Philoſopher ſayes) is the beſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to fooliſh queſtions: And the rather for that he hath therein ſo pourtraied himſelf to the life, that all that are judicious may read what is the man by his manners. But in the ſecond place conſidering that this Lyon couchant, contents not himſelf to rend my Wife in pieces, but alſo ſucks the blood of my reputation, to ſatisfie his greedy Appetite, and makes lies his refuge for all his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt actings, it being granted to every man to ſpeake in the defence of his own innocency, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly queſtioned and wrongfully ſlandred: (this wound reaching to the very ſoul) I have reſolved (by Gods aſſiſtance) in a few following ſheets, to diſcuſſe and examine his late precious piece or Pamphlet, and to diſcover both it, and 'its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to the world in their Proper colours. And herein 'its not my purpoſe to deal with every thing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101327:28"/>that lies fair to exception: were I every way as able as my Antagoniſt, much leſſe is it my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to write after his blotted Copy; I have learned better of my Lord and Maſter Chriſt, when I am revilea not to revile again, remembring what one ſayes, that no Adverſary (ſuppoſe the Devil himſelf) is to be anſwered either with affection or paſsion; but by ſound reaſon and Religion, and I have reaſon to believe, That M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> might have done himſelf and his Church better ſervice by his ſilence or a modest Retractation, then he hath done with all his paſsion and bitter Exclamations. I hope all men are not ſo prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt to look upon all he ſayes, as Oracles; nor eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one bound up, by an Implicite faith, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as he and his Church believe. Wiſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall Iudges are wont to reſerve an eare for the defendant, ere they determine the Cauſe: All that I expect, is the like common Iuſtice from all, that ſhall be pleaſed to exerciſe their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in peruſall of my enſuing defence, which how weak ſoever, it, or the Authour be, yet having Truth and innocency for our ſupport, which is ſtrong and prevalent, is commended to thy impartiall conſideration by thine and the Truths ſuffering friend</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T would be to little purpoſe to ſpend time, in deſcanting on the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Title, and many paſſages in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Stucleys</hi> Book, that diſcovers more frothy wit, then Chriſtian wiſdome or gravitie.</p>
            <p>It would be alſo tedious and troubleſome to enumerate the odious railing names and Epithites of <hi>Cham, Iſmael, Shimei, Rabſheka,</hi> apoſtate; broadfac'd lie, braſenfac'd lie, putid lie, egregious lie, with ſuch like excrementitious ſtuffe, that hath drop't from his venemous pen; and wherewith his Book is full fraught, as if compoſed at Bedlam or Billings-gate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming any ſober Chriſtian, much more a Paſtor of a congregation.</p>
            <p>I paſſe by the taking notice of his many quibbles, ſcoffs, and jeeres, his pride and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, his paſſion and impudence ſo obvious in every leaf, that he that runs may read; And with reference to theſe things, content my ſelf only to ſay (as <hi>Catalus</hi> to his inſulting <hi>Nonius</hi>) what a deal of dung doth this cart carry, ſuch unſavoury unſanctified language ſuits not a ſanctified ſpirit, fitter for the cookingſtoole then the preſſe.</p>
            <p>But to come to particulars; In the firſt place, I ſhall onely glance on ſome paſſages of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:101327:29"/>
            <p> That there is poiſon and gall in ink (as he affirmes) I ſhall not queſtion, ſith his Book puts it out of queſtion, the Reader will find it growing upon his dung-heap.</p>
            <p>In the next place M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> preſents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the Reader, as in a great ſtraight or dilemma; whether he ſhould be ſilent, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer my <hi>Narrative</hi> (which he ſtiles a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) and layes down reaſons; <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why is this preamble?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I tell thee Reader, Hypocriſie was never more in ſaſhion then in our times: The vileſt, &amp; moſt abominable practice &amp; deſigne in the world muſt have this preface and varniſh of Religion and conſcience to cover 'its ugly face and form. 'Tis ſad to ſee how men cover wickedneſſe with holyneſſe even the garment of God; But how think you, ſhall M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> gain reputation to his enſuing report of 48. lies, without painting the rotten poſt, and making a fair prologue to ſo foul a piece.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is, that firſt he inſinuates himſelf to be a man of peace, he tells you that he takes litle pleaſure in a <hi>Salamander</hi> life, Though in the mean while, we all know, that it was his firſt work, after his coming to <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to vent his <hi>Antinomian Tenents,</hi> and that in pulpit in contradiction to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bartlets</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divinity and ſound practicall truth; And who knows not who hath been the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101327:29"/>that hath kindled the coales and blown the flames of contention in <hi>Exeter</hi> ever ſince M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> ſet foot there; And yet this is the peaceable man you muſt take his own word for it, for he ſayes he is a Miniſter, but firſt he ſhould have done well to have taken <hi>(Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> along with him, and yet I ſhould have much doubted of his hundreds of Miniſters; that he boaſts, he could have to certifiy for him, I think the number would have fallen very ſhort, onely ſome few of his votaries that he hath helped unto, or kept in good benefices and places, and ſome others for fear of ejecting probably might have done him that Office, we well know, who rules the roſt in theſe parts.</p>
            <p>I ſhall for brevitie ſake paſſe over his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for his ſilence, as not bearing waight with his more preponderating conſiderations, to excite him to anſwer.</p>
            <p>Anſwer he muſt, firſt to prevent the Goſpels ſuffering, ſecondly for his Churches ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel will ſuffer, and his labours be obſtructed, if he be ſilent under Calumnies and miſrepreſentations (as he inſinuates my <hi>Narrative</hi> to be) And therefore (he ſayes) he is bound in conſcience, But what to doe? what bound in conſcience to ly for God? he needs it not, what, bound in conſcience to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and evade Truth by ſhiftings and ſhuflings?
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101327:30"/>To maintaine unwarrantable practices by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and inſolent carriage, denying to give any account or ſatisfaction to any for your actings? what to ſlander cenſure and trample on poore honeſt Souls juſtly diſſenting from you, thereby to raiſe and keep up your own and your Churches tottering <hi>Independent</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, on the ruins of their perſons and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? Surely the Goſpel needs no ſuch ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Pamphlet (in the eye of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſtians) gains little glory to God, little advantage to the Goſpel, little credit to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, or edification to his Church, and Chriſt will give him little thanks one day, for ſuch imprudent and prepoſterous zeal, being not according to knowledge, and will ſay, who hath required theſe things at your hands.</p>
            <p>Pray S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Tell me, where was your conſcience and zeal to preſerve the Goſpel from ſuffering, when you raiſed that falſe report on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Forde,</hi> reporting to one of <hi>Taunton</hi> that he ſaid, That lying was the property of a woman: and when you abuſed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Down</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bartlet</hi> by reports to my Brother at the ſame time? where was your tender reſpect of the Goſpel, when you too frequently aſperſed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Forde,</hi> and would be picking of holes in his Sermons, and telling your members, that he was much diſſabled by his ſickneſſe, whereby many refuſed to hear
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101327:30"/>him for near two years together? Who taught your members to call his Sermons preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Raylings <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is not this your very ſhiboleth to diſtinguiſh a right <hi>Independent?</hi> And why have you and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mall,</hi> now alſo withdrawn from his Lecture: is it not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme your diſciples?</p>
            <p>Reader, Note, this is the man that is ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that his own name be not reproached, leaſt the Goſpel ſuffer, and yet whiſpers and broaches untruths againſt three godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to take away their good names, without any reſpect to the Goſpels ſuffering; how ſtands this together?</p>
            <p>In the next place, whereas M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> tells you, how he adores Gods goodneſſe to him, in hiding his infirmities from me, whom he ſtiles a <hi>Cham,</hi> that would ſoone have publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to my Brethren.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that 'tis not I, but his own harſh irregular actings that have proclaimed not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his infirmities but enormities alſo to the world; For my part I am convinced, 'tis ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to publiſh others infirmities, much more to curſe them for it. But I adore the divine providence, in that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> himſelf ſhould occaſion a diſcovery of his own fowle enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. God hath a time to diſcover the Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of liars: A time when they ſhall proceed no farther, but their folly ſhall be manifeſt unto
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101327:31"/>all: God will bring to light the hidden deeds of darkneſſe in due time, 'tis neither pride nor policy can hinder. Had I publiſhed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> privity to the uncommiſſionated opening of other mens letters, and taking Copies of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Snows,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>VVeſtlakes</hi> Poſtletters, to lay up by him; ſuggeſting to his Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that theſe men endeavoured the ruine of the Church, and that God had broken their deſignes: and appointing thankſgiving dayes for the ſame (a mere trick to alienate their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from them) I ſay, had I publiſhed theſe pranks; I ſuppoſe they would not come under the notion of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Stucleys</hi> infirmities but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of a higher nature. Is it not a petty piece of Burglary think you, to unlock and break o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the cloſed Cabinet of another mans breaſt and boſome, to rob him of his ſecrets, his heart Iewels? is not this ſomewhat above an infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity? If not I ſhould have concealed it, but I dare not be acceſſary to ſuch things, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, My Maſters beware of your letters.</p>
            <p>Next M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> proceeds to rejoyce, That <hi>Shimei</hi> his railing tongue, and <hi>Rabſhekahs</hi> letters ſhould conduce to his and his Churches repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>Stay Reader, peruſe my <hi>Narrative:</hi> where I pray doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> find <hi>Shimei</hi> his railing tongue or <hi>Rabſhekahs</hi> letters? doth he not dream? Is it not in his Pamphlet, he love to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101327:31"/>triumph before the victory: firſt let him take my anſwer intended for his conviction, and then if it conduce to their reputation, much good doe it them, I hope God will work good out of it, when his eyes ſhall be opened to ſee his errour, and to make him ſenſible of his high flown conceits of his; and his Churches infallibilities, &amp; to make him really to adore the divine juſtice towards him, who ſeeks to advance his &amp; his Churches glory and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by the defamation of honeſt conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Chriſtians, who endeavour to walke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly both in the ſight of God and men.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place he ends his Epiſtle with an Apologie for his tartneſs in his enſuing Book; and pleades the Law of nature for doing right to himſelf, forgetting) it ſeems) the Law of grace, that forbids wronging his Neighbour, God is not to be found (as one ſayes) in the rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire of oppoſition, but in the ſweet breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſoft voice of Truth and love.</p>
            <p>I leave his Epiſtle, &amp; proceed to take a ſhort ſurvey of what follows in his Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>In his firſt page, he cavils at the Title of my Book in that 'its called, Truths manifeſt, and ſeeks to cloud it, with a thicke fog or miſt of 48. lies which I doubt not ere I have done, will call him father, and be juſtly laid at his own door: of theſe in their proper place.</p>
            <p>In his ſecond page, he hath a firivolous quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101327:32"/>or exception againſt the Authour, in that, 'tis ſaid <hi>Toby Allein</hi> a (late) member <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he ſayes denotes; either my excommunication, or diſmiſſion, or Apoſtacie from them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer I was in the firſt place denied Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with his Church, ſome of them told me, they were offended at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Downs</hi> baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my child, and at my forbearing them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meetings, and I muſt not be admitted in ſuch ſins; In the next place I gave them notice that for their unjuſt excommunicating my wife, and refuſing to give any reaſon or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction about it, and for other reaſons (which the reader will ſee ere I have ended) I did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from them, and could walk no longer with them; and ſo I ſtiled my ſelf (a late mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) as I hope was proper enough, though not actually excommunicated, nor diſmiſſed by them; and yet for all this I hope, I am no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an Apoſtate, then Luther was, who ſaid he was an Apoſtate, but it was from errour to truth.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church is now become of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and muſt be ſatisfied, ere they will ſay farewell to <hi>Toby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well ſatisfaction muſt be had, and I hope I ſhall ſatisfie thoſe that are capable of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton; The Church requires ſatisfaction becauſe I ſay; They have unjuſtly curſed my wife; And I require ſatisfaction becauſe they did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly curſe her.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:101327:32"/>
            <p> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> pray S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. be ingenious; have I not offered by word and writing; that I was ready to receive your charge (if you had any againſt me) and to ſubmit to the determination of godly judicious, and indifferent Miniſters or private Chriſtians? And have you not refuſed this; Calling them forreiners; and will referre it to none but your own Church, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh, Owen,</hi> &amp;c. parties as deeply guilty as your ſelfe, in this male adminiſtration, theſe muſt be the indifferent Judges. To determine whether you and themſelves have done right, or wrong in your proceedings, none elſe muſt intermeddle in your Church affaires, and why? 'Tis your principle, a principle without Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture precept or preſident, a punctilio, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to wave and evade the hearing of the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, leaſt the nakedneſſe of your cauſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and your ſhame be diſcovered. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. I hope you did Reverence learned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs,</hi> if ſo, pray take the paines to look into his Heart-diviſions pag. 43: where he ſayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thoſe in the Congregationall way acknowledge, that they are bound in conſcience to give account of their wayes to the Churches about them, or to any other, who ſhall require it, this (ſaith he) not in an Arbitrary way, but as a duty they own to God and man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve, he makes no diſtinction, but ſayes to the Churches about them; or any other,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101327:33"/>that ſhall require it. And this he ſpeaks not only as his own opinion, but as the judgement of thoſe of the congregationall way in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Pray tell me, how you will reconcile your practice with this judgement? I would willingly know why? or upon what different principle it was, that you refuſed to give M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Nicolls,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bartlet,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Downe</hi> any account or ſatisfaction touching the reaſon &amp; grounds of thoſe your proceedings, when thoſe three Miniſters deſired it, after you had ſent them your monition (in the nature of a mandatum) that they were to take notice that you and your Church had Excommunicated M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parr</hi> and my wife: did you adviſe with any of the Churches in <hi>Exeter</hi> or elſewhere before your precipitate proceedings? Pray let's know in your next how it was reſented by your brethren of the congregational way, at your late conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the Act in <hi>Oxford</hi> (if truly ſtated by you which I muſt ſuſpect) did they commend your practice (as it is reported) and intend to draw it into preſident, or did they blame you for it? Have you known any power either Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, or Archiepiſcopall, (but only Papall) that claime ſuch an abſolute <hi>Independent</hi> juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as to deny all Appeales; and refuſe to give any account of their wayes, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations) when deſired) before <hi>Independency</hi> was ſet up? Pray what meant you by your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101327:33"/>to the Miniſters in <hi>Exon,</hi> was it not, that they ſhould deny theſe poore ſouls commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon paine of your and your Churches high diſpleaſure, muſt your <hi>(Ipſe dixit)</hi> ſatisfie, without ground or reaſon? If this be your principle, we doubt not but within a few pages to ſhew who are the <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> whether M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> and his Church, or <hi>Toby Allein;</hi> But of that by and by, I paſſe on to his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on my Teſtimoniall.</p>
            <p>Reader, here ſee (this peaceable man) how his heart riſes and ſwells againſt the chamber of <hi>Exon.</hi> (as he call's the Subſcribers to my certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate) he will not be guilty of ſuch a piece of incivility, as to ſuffer them to paſſe without abuſing them, he muſt have a fling at them, now they come in his way.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place he gibes at their Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of juſtice, we muſt (ſayes he) carry our ſelves warily, leaſt we be bound to the good behaviour warily, not honeſtly, he begins with a jeer.</p>
            <p>Pag. 3. Next, in his third and ſome enſuing pages; He call's them my Compurgatours, prolocutours, Seconds, guard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and tacit'ly repreſents them, as men diſſaffected to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Magiſtrate, with his jearing <hi>(Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum admiſsi,</hi> &amp;c.) and that his Highneſs affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to him, is an eie-ſore to the chamber, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Reader this is the peaceable man ſtill, If thou
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101327:34"/>wilt believe him, he takes no pleaſure in a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamander</hi> life, and yet <hi>Toby Allein</hi> and his wife are not ſubjects high enough to wreak and fret his malice upon.</p>
            <p>No, the chamber: they muſt know that he is offended at them alſo, and they and all the world muſt know, what a favourite of the <hi>Protectors,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> is, he put's it in print. But alas (poor man) how vain is it to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with thoſe that care ſo little for it: doubtleſs the chamber takes notice of it, ſo farre, as to be ſorry for his ſimpleneſs, and that ſuch a ſpirit of envy and contention ſhould lie Couchant, and diſcover it ſelf from under M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> paſtorall Robe, They can bear a few gibes and jeeres from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley,</hi> and look on it as his weakneſs, and that it would be weakneſs in them to ingage in a Conteſt with him about ſuch things ſo inconſiderable. The <hi>Eagle</hi> ſcorns to catch flies; I ſhall onely ſay, that had I ſaid &amp; inſinuated ſo much of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Exeter,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Stucley</hi> hath done, It might have been called, an <hi>Impudent</hi> lye.</p>
            <p>But we leave him in his ſweat of diſcontent againſt the chamber, and ſhall ſpeak a word of his query, why I had not gotten a Certificate from the Miniſters or from his Church, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as he ſayes) reported his Church to be the honeſteſt people that ever I came amongſt.</p>
            <p>To this briefly, That as for the Miniſters—Certificate
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101327:34"/>I might have had it, had I needed it; And as for his Churches Certificate, I left it for him to take the benefit of that, being the beſt he can get; And as for his Church, If I reported them to be the honeſteſt people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>I do now find I was in a great miſtake, and muſt retract and ask them forgiveneſſe; I ſhall promiſe to ſay ſo no more till I have better evidence for their honeſty: I am not the firſt that have been deceived by theſe <hi>Independents;</hi> and therefore I hope I may expect a pardon of Courſe. Next M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> raiſes <hi>queries,</hi> upon the contents of my Teſtimoniall, (ſimple ones God knows:) how eaſy is it to pay him home in his own Coyne; May it not be ask't of him, 1. whether he as not an unrighteous Steward in his cauſeleſſe curſing my wife? Secondly whether he be not better affected to his <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> party and intereſt, then to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth? thirdly whether he hath not rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more diviſions in the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>Exeter</hi> by gathering a Church out of other Churches, then ever was known in <hi>Exeter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? But to let that paſſe, I ſhall only adde,</p>
            <p>That the Certifiers (however M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> repreſents them) are known to be men of that worth, loyalty and integrity, that they diſdaine for any reſpects whatſoever to certifie any thing but what they know to be really truth: And had they not been ſo, doubtleſs he would
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101327:35"/>have long ſince informed againſt them; or elſe had neglected his duty.</p>
            <p>Pag. 4. Whereas in his fourth page he inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates that I am to have a triall at Law againſt him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, be pleaſed to take notice, that after M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> had libellouſly ſlandred my wife in pulpit and print, before I printed my <hi>Narrative</hi> I demanded (by ſeverall letters) ſatisfaction for this publick defamation, as a breach of the Laws both of God and man: Telling him, that if he would ſhew the matter of fact truly ſtated, and a poſſitive Scripture, or Law of man, for ſuch a procedure on ſuch a fact or 'its parallel, he ſhould convince me.</p>
            <p>I likewiſe ſent him a charge; conſiſting of four particulars, (to wit) firſt his application of <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.8.9. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.5. to my wife, inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating her to be a harlot and unchaſt: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly his reporting her to be a woman know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſubjection at home or abroad, Thirdly, his ſaying, that ſhe went from them to avoid Curch cenſure: Fourthly his reporting that ſhe never gave any reaſon for her leaving them: I charged him that in theſe particulars he had ſcandalized my wife, and therein bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken both the Law of God and man. I deſired a debate of theſe particulars by himſelf and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Mall</hi> (his aſſiſtant,) and two others whom he thought fit with my ſelf and three other
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101327:35"/>godly Chriſtians that I ſhould bring, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that if he could prove either of them, nay, if I did not diſprove all of them, I would lay down and beg him mercy.</p>
            <p>His anſwer was, that this charging him with particulars, he did not like, and that it was not the way of gaining him; But that I was to tell him his fault between me and him alone; And failing in that firſt aſſay; Then I was to take with me, one or two of that particular fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (meaning his Church) and that untill then he ſaw no reaſon at all to call in forraign helps.</p>
            <p>Note Reader, this learned <hi>Rabbi,</hi> he tells me that I muſt firſt tell him of his treſpaſſe private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which himſelf hath publiſhed on the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top, in pulpit and preſſe.</p>
            <p>I thought he had known better how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, as to the Application of Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that there is a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the caſe of private perſonall wrongs; And publick Church male adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>Next (ſayes he) I muſt take two or three of his Church; They were partakers in the fact of curſing my wife; And they are to admoniſh him for that, which they joyned with him to doe.</p>
            <p>Note, he wholly declines my propoſall, and hath found out this ſhift, he tells me the Church are offended, that I take offence at their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; And ſummons me to his conſiſtarie
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101327:36"/>before M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Eveleigh, Owen,</hi> and the reſt, judges in their own cauſe: for them to debate, and determine whether he &amp; they had done right or no: you may imagine what a piece of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice I might expect from them. Right <hi>Lid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Law. Hereupon I gave notice to the Church by letter, that foraſmuch as they had abuſed the Ordinance of Chriſt, in Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating my wife on ſuch pretended crimes as were apparent falſities; I had therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from them, and could neither in reaſon nor conſcience joyn with ſuch a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as live wholly under an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> form of Church Goverment, and admitted of no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales in the caſe of unjuſt excommunication.</p>
            <p>And ſo, after M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> deniall of a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debate often propoſed by me, I was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to commence my ſuit at Law, to right my ſelf in way of a legall proceeding. And this is the action of the caſe, he there ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p>It would be almoſt infinite to follow him in every of his impertinencies and frothy fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, I purpoſely wave many as inconſiderable, and ſhall ſpeake only to the moſt material, that I tire not the Reader.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> hath done with my Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and now taking leave of the chamber, with his <hi>pace tantorum virorum,</hi> a jeering fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, he paſſes to my Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>He begins with a whipper: Scandall &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101327:36"/>(ſayes he) was proved againſt my wife, and therefore her cenſure was not unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: good Logick, were it true; yea, but he will prove it by his Sermon notes (alias) his printed libel: I referre you, ſaies he, to the notes of my Sermon in print. A very ſtrong evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a cogent argument. He and his Church muſt curſe my wife for deſerting them and joyning to her former paſtor, but ſcandall, and contumacy muſt be the gloſſe and pretence for their proceedings. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> preaches, &amp; prints her guilty; And that's his proof. They ſay ſo; And therefore 'tis ſo; they are ſatisfied, and therefore others muſt me.</p>
            <p>The Phariſees ſay that Chriſt had a Devil, and therefore it muſt be ſo; <hi>probatum eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe a vile wretch (being met with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of his Deſciples, as bad as himſelf) do preach and print blaſphemy (as many doe in theſe dayes) is it true? or is it ever the leſſe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, becauſe he preaches and prints it, and his Deſciples own and maintain it? This is ſorry ſtuff.</p>
            <p>Next we are now come to the point, the whole ſtreſſe of the buſineſſe in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> and my ſelf lies in this, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether my wife were guilty of Crimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving excomminication, or not deſerving? whether guilty of contumacy, or not guilty? in a word, whether his curſe be cauſeleſs or not?</p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:101327:37"/>
            <p> I am not ignorant that I am to encounter, one, that Goliah-like ſeems to bee armed <hi>Cap-a pe;</hi> He is a Scholer, which I pretend not to, therefore the diſadvantage lies on my ſide; But I truſt my cauſe is good, and my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne is ſatisfaction, and therefore ſhall not fear to take leave humbly to propoſe a few <hi>queries</hi> to ſerious conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, whether a particular Church may impoſe, preſſe or practice any thing that is not warranted by Scripture precept, Apoſtolicall iuſtitution, or primitive Church practice?</p>
            <p>Secondly, whether, If ſuch things be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed preſſed or drawen into practice, by a particular Church, the Church members may not refuſe it as arbitrary and after their decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diſſatisfaction in point of conſcience may not withdrawe from ſuch Church, till they receive ſatisfaction; and for non-ſatisfaction, wholly deſert it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly whether a particular Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, or tying up it's members by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, compact or otherwiſe from commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with other Churches of Chriſt in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and it's refuſing to admit the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of other Churches of Chriſt (profeſſed believers and orderly livers) to communicate with them, in the ordinances, be warrantable by Scripture rule, Apoſtolicall inſtitution, or primative practice, or on the contrary, be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101327:37"/>&amp; ſchiſme in ſuch particular Church.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, whether there be any Scripture Rule, or Parſident, for a particular Church, to erect private meetings, and there to pray, preach, and carry on deſignes and particular intereſts, relating to ſtate affaires to promote ſelf-edification in ſtead of ſole-edification?— and if not.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, whether a Churchmember, ſeeing the danger, and taking offence at ſuch practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, having declared againſt it, may not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience abſtaine and withdraw from ſuch, and joyn in the ordinances with other congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Gods people, without incurring the guilt of Shciſme.</p>
            <p>In the next place I ſhall point M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley,</hi> to ſome paſſages of the late reverend and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Burroughs</hi> in his heart-diviſions pag. 173. &amp; 174.</p>
            <p>If (ſayes he) <hi>the cauſe of leaving communion be juſt, then thoſe who gave this cauſe are the ſchiſmatiks, not thoſe who withdraw upon it, thus the Governors of the Church may be the ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and a private member withdrawing may be free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, if Governours impoſe that which is not neceſſary (though in it ſelf not ſinful) and will not beare with the weakneſſes of ſuch, as think it to be evill, if upon that, they be forced to withdrawe in this the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101327:38"/>are the <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And againe in pag. 50. The power of the Church (ſayes he) extends not to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every thing, that either may by the Governours of it be conceived to be evill, or that is indeed evill, but onely ſuch things, as ſome way or other appeare to be againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and are obſtinately perſiſted on, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And in pag. 52. thoſe that will goe farther, they will puniſh for every evill, and if they uſe meanes to convince them, and they be not convinced, they will judge them obſtinate, &amp; proceed againſt them accordingly, thoſe challenge &amp; exerciſe not the power of Chriſt, but Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>And againe pag. 67. this is generally held by our Brethren (ſaith he) If a man be rightly caſt out of communion with one Church, he is thereby caſt out of all. If this be ſo (ſayes he) then ſurely many things muſt be ſuffered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed to caſt out a member, it muſt not be for every error of miſcarriage, thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. Davenant in his rules for peace, theſe may not be cut off from communion with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, who remaine joyned to the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>And againe pag. 90. Prelatical ſpirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed account it their honour to force men to be of their mind; 'tis their glory, that they can ſay to the conſciences of men, bow downe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101327:38"/>before us: a gracious ſpirit abhorrs the thought of ſuch a Tyrany.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus-premiſed and conſidered, I apply it to the caſe in hand, in theſe few en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing queres.</p>
            <p>Firſt I enquire, what other meaning or conſtruction but impoſing and preſſing things unneceſſary, can be made or put on thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and practices in your Covenant (for ſo your Elder M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Eveleigh</hi> named it to me and my wife) <hi>(viZ.)</hi> that we ſhould hear you, when you preacht, and noe others, without your leave, and that we muſt expect a greater bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on your Miniſtry, then any others, and that we muſt frequent your private meetings, or be accountable to you and your officers for our default? Have you any Scripture-rule or primitive Church practice for theſe, and for ſuch preſſing of them (as your Elder did) on me and my wife to ſubſcribe unto them? and as for your denying liberty to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate at the Lords table with other Churches of Chriſt, where is your Scripture-rule or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it? Is not this an impoſing and preſſing of things unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place I enquire, whether I and my wife did not refuſe to ſubſcribe this Covenant upon grounds of diſſatisfaction, in point of conſcience: pray ask your Elder, did I not tell him I muſt firſt ſee direct proof, or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101327:39"/>ſound conſequence from Scripture, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me that this was an injunction of Chriſt and not arbitrarie, ere I could ſubmit to it.</p>
            <p>And pray ask him farther, did not my wife tell him that ſhe found no ſuch rule of Chriſt, not obligation upon Chriſtians, and could not in conſcience ſubmit or yield to be ſo tied up, but deſired to ſtand faſt in the liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt had made her free, or that effect, this, I ſay we did refuſe to be ingaged unto in point of conſcience.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I enquire farther, did not my wife tell M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Eveleigh</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>whitehorne,</hi> two of your members, that came to admoniſh her for not comming to your private meetings, that ſhe was offended at your carrying on ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh deſignes and intereſts, under pretence of ſerving God, at ſuch times, appearing both in your prayers and practices, and that ſhe could not, with a good conſcience joyn with ſuch, but would leave you, eſpecially after ſhe had heard <hi>Capt. Rolls</hi> his ſtrange praying, and the Churches perrilous petitioning the <hi>Protector,</hi> which you ſent me to ſubſcribe, whereof the danger was repreſented to her as my <hi>Narrative</hi> doth expreſſe, had ſhe not juſt cauſe to take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at this? were not ſuch things enough to ſtumble a woman, to make her fear &amp; in point of conſcience and prudence alſo, to avoid this apprehended danger, both to ſoul and body? Pray let it be conſidered.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:101327:39"/>
            <p> But now I mention this petition, I muſt take heed for Mr. <hi>Stucley</hi> is offended as you may ſee in page 7.</p>
            <p>Where he makes the Reader believe he hath gotten me into his Net, into a dilemma inextricable; That unavoidable I muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Traitour, or a lier, here he puts a bold face on a bad matter; But pray not too faſt, let's along with you.</p>
            <p>Reader take notice that in my <hi>Narrative</hi> I was telling the grounds and occaſion of my wifes withdrawing from them, That ſhe heard a friend ſay, that there were dangerous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, in their Church Petition, which they brought me to ſigne; And in particular a clauſe, to pray the <hi>Protector</hi> to diſſolve the Parliament, and I told you alſo that this (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things) did, (as it well might) trouble her, and cauſe her, to cautionate me to be wary what I did, and at length for this and other reaſons before recited, to withdraw from them.</p>
            <p>For my part I never read the petition, nor knew 'its contents whether there were any treaſonable undertaking in it or nor, let the contrivers and ſubſcribers look to that, I did mention it in my <hi>Narrative</hi> only to ſhew the occaſion and ground of my wifes diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and one reaſon of her deſerting them, I had not the leaſt deſign to alienate the chief
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101327:40"/>Governors affections from him &amp; his Church (as he ſuggeſts) I fear not the guilt of miſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Treaſon; But yet ſeeing M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> puts me ſo hard to it, I ſhall ſee whether we can extricate our ſelves out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> dilemma, and that I may not be guilty of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion of Treaſon, and others may ſee who is the Traitour or the liar, I ſhall here inſert what I have heard (and doubtleſs M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> will not deny) was the heads or ſubſtance of their Church-petition as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Should this change be</hi> (viz.) <hi>the Kingly office be accepted, how much will the liberty of the Saints be hazarded; And will you put on the yoak of intolerable ſlavery on their necks with your own hands, and rivet it faſt by a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Power from falling of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can your Highneſſe be ignorant, that there is too much of an impoſing ſpirit in matters of conſcience, ſtill remaining in the middeſt of us, who would gladly deny liberty to thoſe who have earned it with their bloud; and muſt we again forſake our inheritances &amp; eſtates, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We cannot but remember your Highneſſe; That the itch that was upon the ſpirits of men (nothing could ſatisfie them, unleſs they could put their fingers on their Brothers conſcience to pinch it) is not yet healed, what aſſurance will the Parliament give, that your Army, who are at preſent a fence between us, and fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpirits) ſhall be continued?</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:101327:40"/>
            <p> And is it not ſufficiently known that many of thoſe perſons that cry up Monarchy, as hereditary, are crying down of a Military Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, as inconſiſtent with magna charta and the liberty of the Nation?</p>
            <p>If the Militia be kept in your Highneſſe hands, it was that which was thought unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for the King to pretend to: If left in the Parliament, ſo choſen by the Nation as now qualified; may it not eaſily be preſaged how ſuddenly they ſhall be disbanded? or what ground or hope hath your Highneſſe, that the ſpirits of the Common people are now more wary in picking and chuſing Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives then of old?</p>
            <p>Did you not lately ſee what need you had of your counſell to ſet guards on the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to keep out <hi>Malignant</hi> and violent ſpirits, though we fear, notwithſtanding all their vigilancy, there are but too many crept within thoſe doores.</p>
            <p>How unreaſonable is it, that they who came together by virtue of this Government ſhould now be permitted to pull it down?</p>
            <p>If it were thought unreaſonable that any ſhould ſit without a recognition: Is it not moſt intolerable (pardon our boldneſs) that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of the Government, ſhould be let alone their months being long ſince expired? Doth it lie in your Highneſs breaſt to ſecure the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101327:41"/>againſt ſuch Invadors? Will not this as dangerouſly diſſappoint, and diſcompoſe the Nation as any thing that could have been invented, by the greateſt enemies to your peace and welfare?</p>
            <p>Laſtly are not the ſame weeds, nettles and briars thriving under this Parliament as under tholaſt; And are there not the ſame reaſons, for their diſſolution, as for the former?</p>
            <q>May it therefore pleaſe your Highneſſe to lay theſe things cloſe upon your heart, and not to conſent to ſuch alterations and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Reader; there needs no <hi>Paraphraſe;</hi> Theſe heads were given by one of their own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (no Apoſtate) and therefore I think Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Stucley</hi> will not ſay, 'tis a lie or a falſe copy, only I cannot paſſe it by, without a <hi>query</hi> or two.</p>
            <p>Firſt I ask why M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> himſelf, had not printed their petition in his Book, he ſayes he was not aſhamed to tell the world of it, and yet conceales it; If it were ſo honeſt why had you not printed it?</p>
            <p>Secondly I would ask him, whether it were recomended to him and his Church by his holyneſſe from <hi>Rome;</hi> or was it compoſed within the walls of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Raddons</hi> Poſthouſe in <hi>Exeter</hi> at their private meetings?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I would know whether thoſe that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101327:41"/>ſubſcribed it were <hi>Engliſhmen, Italians,</hi> or <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly whether Religion doth challenge any other place then to be a ſettler, no ſticker in the State?</p>
            <p>Fifthly whether ſome eminent Stateſmen did not diſcourage M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mall</hi> (your Agitator) from preſenting it, and whether it were not turn'd back to be laid aſide, or amended?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, whether ſuch Church work might not juſtly offend weak members, and put them upon thoughts of ſatisfaction before they joyn farther with ſuch a Church?</p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stueley</hi> will take ſome pains to give ſome ſolution and ſatisfaction to theſe <hi>queries</hi> in his next, which I ſhall content my ſelf to waite for with patience; And that I may no farther digreſſe, I return to examine his allegations of my wifes ſuppoſed crimes and contumacy, deſerving excommunication; and here I find he would make the world believe, that 'twas not for deſerting them and going to her former Paſtor: this he thinks will not hold, though this in truth was at the bottome. But now (for-ſooth) it muſt be running away from her husband.</p>
            <p>Reader for ſatisfaction in this, read my <hi>Narrative,</hi> which ſhews the true cauſe, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and end of my wifes going to <hi>Honiton,</hi> which he falſly call's running away.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:101327:42"/>
            <p> The truth is, her ſpirit was troubled at thoſe ſorry actings in the Church, which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet forth; ſhe ſaw mad Church work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, ſhe feared entanglements and could not in conſcience continue longer with them as I preſſed her to do; therefore ſhe deſires ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and on that occaſion and no other, ſhe went to <hi>Honiton</hi> in order to go to <hi>Taunton</hi> to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Newton,</hi> and my Brother <hi>Allein,</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Taunton</hi> for ſolution of her doubts. I appeale to the impartiall Readers.</p>
            <p>What think ye? might not this intended ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up by covenant to a particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; debarring her of the liberty of Church priviledges in Communion with other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and their ingaging in State affairs in ſo unheard of a manner, make a good woman to uſe means for ſatisfaction, and quiet of her conſcience, when ſhe had told them and me, ſhe could not in conſcience continue with them? and ſhe was told, ſhe could not leave them: might not this, I ſay, cauſe her to be importunate for ſatisfaction without danger of excommunication?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But they object; ſhe went away, and I knew not of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer; ſhe had told me before that ſhe would go ſomewhat for ſatisfaction; and I had before agreed to her going to <hi>Taunton</hi> for it. But ſuppoſe I did not for preſent know
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101327:42"/>whether ſhe was gone; what then? muſt ſhe therefore be run away? None but an <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> will judge ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But 'tis farther objected, why then did ye grieve at her going away and ſaid, ſhe would leave you?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this I anſwer, 'tis falſe, I never ſaid ſhe would leave me, whatever you vouchers <hi>Capt. Rolls,</hi> and <hi>Owen</hi> do tell you. They are your own Diſciples; and have been her accuſers and judges.</p>
            <p>Secondly I ſay, I had reaſon to be troubled: firſt at the ill uſe and advantage I apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch as you (who watcht for her haltings) would make of it. And again ſecondly, becauſe I had no ſooner complyed &amp; condeſcended to the healing of her troubled ſpirit, but had too much hearkned to ſome of your cruel coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells and inſtigations againſt her.</p>
            <p>Let me put M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> a <hi>querie</hi> or two?</p>
            <p>Firſt let me ask him did I ever complain to him or his Church or any other, that my wife was run away, and require a Church proceedings about it? or did he or his Church ever ask me whether ſhe did run away or not, or whether there were a reconciliation, did any of them examine the caſe before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to curſe her?</p>
            <p>Secondly, did not he and his Church (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing madded at her leaving them) in point of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101327:43"/>policy or rather revenge conſpire to ſpread and foment this falſe report, and then call it a publick Scandall, paſt her husbands pardon, and ſuch as he and his Church muſt take co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnizance of <hi>ex officio,</hi> and curſe her, for unleſs ſhe would cry <hi>peccavi,</hi> though innocent. This will be the caſe another day, whatever they pretend to hide it now. She had left them: they could not brook it, therefore they ſeek occaſion and finding none, They feign and frame ſomewhat that they may have ſome ſhew for the work: it muſt be done <hi>in Terro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</hi> Strict Diſcipline againſt the wife, may chance deterr the husband from going away; for they now fear his departure too. To looſe a Church member may be ominous.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ask M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> this queſtion, If he and his Church had ſo good a cauſe, and could prove their pretended crimes againſt my wife, why was this conſcientious Paſtor ſo rigid, as to refuſe a hearing and debate of their accuſations before M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ford,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Down,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nominated by my wife, whereby he and his Church might have been cieared and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in their proceedings, had their pretended delinquent been convicted?</p>
            <p>Where was this mans wiſdome or charity (I would fain know?) who rather then he would abate a hairs breadth of his greatneſſe and honour (that proves his ſhame) he will
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:101327:43"/>give my wife to the Devil, ſend her packing to hell; where is this mans Scripture-rule, or Church preſident for ſuch a wilfull procedure?</p>
            <p>Hear learned <hi>Zanchie,</hi> treating about Church power in the point of excommunication.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is more grievous</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>to the whole body of the Church, then to cut off a member from the Body? If a Church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be ſmall and conſiſts not of many learned men,</hi> (as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleys I am ſure doth not) <hi>excommunication ought not to be done, unleſſe the neighbour Churches be firſt conſulted withall. A chirurgion (if he fear God and be wiſe) doth not cut off a hand or an arme, before he hath firſt heard the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the skilfull neighbour phyſitians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the late reverend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Vines</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, pag. 212. ſayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The proper and Adequate, and immediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of debarriment from the Communion of the Church is a Sandalous perſon, that holds either a courſe, or hath committed the act of a ſcandalous ſin,</hi> which he explaines to be, ſome Atrocious or grievous ſin of the firſt magnitude, <hi>If any that is called a Brother be a fornicatour, Idolater, covetous,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 5. and 1 Cor. 6.9. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God, nor fornicatours, Idolaters, adulterers, abuſers of themſelves with mankind, nor theeves, nor coveteous, nor drunkards,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101327:44"/>nor revilers, nor extortioners, and ſuch were ſome of you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And pag. 213. <hi>He tels us it muſt be an open and manifeſt ſin, elſe it is not Scandalous:</hi> And known it muſt be either by evidence of fact, confeſſion or conviction.</p>
            <p>Now let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> ſhew wherein my wife was guilty of any ſuch Atrocious or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſin, and if not, why fall's he upon this higheſt work of excommunication?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Little flies</hi> (ſayes M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Vines) <hi>muſt not be knockt down with ſo great a hammer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> True (ſayes my Adverſary.) But there was contumacy that your wife was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer firſt, if no crime, no contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly ſuppoſe a fault, I deny any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy: what contumacy? when ſhe had made ſo many overtures to be tried by indifferent judges, godly indifferent Miniſters or people: what contumacy? when the poor women wrote to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> their deſires, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to his Church, to have their cauſe heard by underſtanding and impartiall men whoſoever they be, and gave aſſurance, that they would ſubmit to the Law and will of Chriſt, which letter, this faithfull Paſtor poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketted and concealed from his Church, you ſee what a good will he had to the work; he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101327:44"/>would curſe them right or wrong, where is the contumacy in her? was it not Tyranny in him? doth he not deſerve a Biſhoprick.</p>
            <p>By this time (I ſuppoſe) the Reader ſees, how pertinent and applicable M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Malls</hi> quotations are to the caſe of my wifes unjuſt excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; And whether ſhe were guilty of crimes or contumacy deſerving ſuch a cruel cenſure, unjuſtly inflicted by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> and his Church, I leave it to the judicious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
            <p>Before I paſſe, I take notice that in his 5. pag. he tells you, that I am willing to wave the queſtion about the impertinency of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Malls</hi> quotations, and to referre it to the learned, and ſayes that I ſhould have ſtudied the queſtion, and not contented my ſelf with an implicit faith in the learned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, I think the queſtion is now put out of queſtion, and by what hath been cited out of thoſe learned men before named, it plainly appeares that his quotations are fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and impertinent to the caſe in hand, let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>And as for an implicit faith in the learned, I ſay an implicit faith in Church affairs, is no way ſatisfactory unto me; And therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Mr. <hi>Stucley</hi> to ſatisfy me; whether he did not tye up his Church-members to an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit faith in him, when he did upon that black
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101327:45"/>day of his curſe, make his members ſubſcribe a Church-covenant or oath, That they would ſubmit to his guidance and teaching as their Paſtor, (abſolutely) without any reſtriction or limitation? why had it not been added, he guiding and teaching according to the rule of Gods word? what is this but to pin their faith on his ſleeve? what is it but an implicit faith on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> durſt not be ſo bold; he bids the Churches be followers of him; and the other Apoſtles, as they are followers of Chriſt; are we not bid, to the Law and to the Teſtimony? bid ſearch the Scriptures, bid try the ſpirits? Muſt we take up all you ſay upon Truſt? are there no deceivers gone forth into the world, and into the Church too? Wolves in ſheeps clothing ſuch as (like the Devil) transform themſelves into Angels of light, creep into houſes &amp; captivate ſilly women, &amp;c. Pray Sir tell me why was this omitted in your Church-covenant or oath, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mall</hi> hath inſerted in his Book? ſhould not oathes and covenants be plain and expreſſe? or will you ſupply it with an <hi>&amp; caetera.</hi> Have you not herein outwitted the Pope, and made him a younger Brother? Surely there is ſomewhat lies in this pad, pray explain your ſelf next.</p>
            <p>Reader I am ſenſible that I have been too tedious hitherto, and ſhould I trace this fox in his wiles and cunning fetches in every page, I
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101327:45"/>ſhould tire both you and my ſelf to unkennell him; I profeſſe I am heartily ſorry to ſee his impudence; he would make the world believe the Crow is white, and that 'tis night at noon by his Logick all are lies, but what he himſelf ſayes; he ſees he is ingaged head and eares; and muſt make lies his refuge to maintain his and his Churches unjuſt act, like the boy that bid his mother call whore firſt.</p>
            <p>For a man to Cloyſter himſelf up, and like the Owle to decline the light of a hearing, and to be aſhamed to give account to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and others that are diſſatisfied, doth not this in the eie of every judicious Reader ſpeake him guilty and unworthy?</p>
            <p>What hath been already ſaid, anſwers many of his foul Aſperſions I ſhall now contract my ſelf and curſorily run over the reſt.</p>
            <p>And firſt for his affirmation that I and my wife conſented to M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parrs</hi> ſuſpenſion, in pag. 8. I profeſſe we never knew of any ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her, much leſſe joyned in any; her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was (as to me) faire and ſatisfactory, <hi>(Viz)</hi> that ſhe remembred not the things for they accuſed her, and if ſhe were convinced of it, ſhe, would be ſorry for it. I never voted it ſatisfactory and neither knew nor joyned in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch ſuſpenſion, therfore that's an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> part.</p>
            <p>And next as for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> inſiſting on
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101327:46"/>my wifes neglect of admonition. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I anſwer that ſhe did declare unto ſome or one of the officers, her dislike &amp; diſſatisfaction at their carriage in ſeverall particulars aſſoon as ſhe had a convenient opportunity, which proved fatall to her in the end.</p>
            <p>Take notice reader, it was not a Brother or a Siſter ſingly, or a few members, but 'twas the whole Church', they were all as it were hung together in a ſtring. Their tying up the members by compact; their intermedling in State affaires, their carrying on ſelf deſigns, their practicall forbidding communion with other Churches; their traducing thoſe that are not of their way, was a diſeaſe epidemicall, that run through the whole body, and was diſcove'rd by degrees to be the very product of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meetings, as if it had been a part of their Religion. And would it not have been look't upon as a peice of pride &amp; preſumption for my wife to reprehend a whole Church; &amp; ſhould ſhe not (thinke you) have been accounted againſt (as M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parr</hi>) for a contentious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that raiſed diſcord and diſturbance in the Church.</p>
            <p>I ſhall (for brevity's ſake) leap over many of his pages, the ſumme of what he there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; being anſwered occaſionally in my former ſheets.</p>
            <p>I alſo paſſe by his ſilly probabillities in the 14.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101327:46"/>page; which he brings to induce a belief in the reader, that my wife ran away, and intended not for <hi>Taunton,</hi> 'tis fully anſwered.</p>
            <p>His Queries; whether dame muſt ride upon the Mugle of the Mare? and whether <hi>Honiton</hi> be in the way to <hi>Taunton,</hi> and the like are ſo ſordid and ridiculous, as ti's unworthy an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, better be fitting the Tongue of a ſtage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>player then the pen of a Miniſter, every child ſees 'its weakneſſe; and therefore I content my ſelf with the ſaying of the wiſe man, anſwer not a fool according to his folly, leaſt thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be like unto him.</p>
            <p>'Its meerly forged to ſay, that <hi>Iohn Mongwell</hi> reported that Dame ran to Ireland with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther womans husband.</p>
            <p>'Tis falſe alſo that I could not for a while be admitted into my wifes chamber at <hi>Honiton:</hi> &amp; alſo falſe that my wife confeſt that ſhe had left me becauſe of a different way: and that <hi>Honi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Exeter</hi> rang of this Scandall; all of this ſtuff proceeded from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> forge.</p>
            <p>'Tis likewiſe moſt untrue that he affirmes in the 16. page, that my wife refuſed conference with thoſe of the church that were ſent unto her: ſhe would have conferred with them, if others might have been preſent: ſhe well knew they came to intrapp her, as they did M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parr,</hi> dealing with her ſingly.</p>
            <p>I onely adde, that the action of my wife in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101327:47"/>going to <hi>Honyton</hi> was not Scandalous. It was honeſt and upon conſcientious grounds and ends, as in my Narrative is ſet forth.</p>
            <p>In his 17. pag. he falls upon me for negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Church-fellowſhip <hi>i. e.</hi> Neglecting their Conventicles at Mr. <hi>Raddons</hi> poſthouſe, to hear my wife vilifyed and abuſed, and others reproached and ſlandred; and ſee ſelf deſignes promoted. Reader thou haſt heard what broth is boyled at thoſe meetings.</p>
            <p>Note; theſe ſubtle foxes muſt have their private meetings, to diſtill their principles, and gradually to diſcover their practices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their choice diſciples of their own gang, that make no bones to ſwallow any thing that their infallable Maſter doth impoſe or command: witneſs their Subſcripſion to his impoſed Covenant, binding them to follow his guidance and teaching abſolutely without any reſtriction or limitation: witneſſe, their ſtickling Church-ſtate petition and the like, of which thou haſt already heard.</p>
            <p>For my part I am farr from decrying or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt the meetings of Gods people, either in publique or or in private, as there is or may becauſe or occaſion.</p>
            <p>But what need this private meeting, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by ſtrict injunction and to be frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon paine of Caſtigation I profeſſe I can ſee neither warrant for it, nor good of it: what
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101327:47"/>is done: there you have partly heard is it not to ſtrengthen the members in their ſeparation from other Churches of Chriſt, and to infuſe farther dividing principles, to widen the Breach, that they may work their own ends? why not publique meetings that all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may ſee and heare what they doe, what they pray, and what they preach and practice as other Churches doe.</p>
            <p>I am of opinion that we ought to admoniſh, inſtruct, comfort &amp; edify any of Gods people of what ſocietie ſoever, at all times as there is occaſion &amp; opportunity. But not of your vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Owens</hi> opinion, <hi>that we are to love thoſe of your Societie, as a man loves his wife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other women,</hi> I know no ſuch rule.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſſe, I am very much for publick meetings, ſince I ſo much obſerved their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate tranſactions; I much better like our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique adminiſtration of juſtice in open legall Courts in the face of the country, ſince I have taken notice of ſome chamber proceedings before private Comittes. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Raddons</hi> Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe was the Conclave, where M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> and his Church did curſe M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parr</hi> and my wife.</p>
            <p>As for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> cavills, and exceptions againſt me for my pretended neglecting Church fellowſhip; I referr the Reader to my letter in my Narrative, which was to have been
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101327:48"/>communicated to his Church; had he been faithful, which will give a ſatisfactory anſwer.</p>
            <p>I muſt ſay ſomewhat to <hi>Tom Savery's</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which for the excellency of it M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> hath put in print, pag. 19.</p>
            <p>The very reading of it with obſervation and reference to the matter then in Queſtion, makes good what I have ſaid concerning it in my Narrative.</p>
            <p>Note in the beginning of his letter, he ſayes, <hi>His ſoul is grieved for my diſorderly walking, I meane</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your abſenting your ſelf from our private meetings &amp;c.</hi> Then followes; <hi>if the wife of your booſome divert you, &amp;c.</hi> That is (ſee the ſcope of his letter) divert you from our private meetings, what then? he tells me out of <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26.27, 33: <hi>if any one come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife &amp;c. he cannot be my diſciple.</hi> See his good Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: If my wife divert me from their private meetings (you have heard what they are) If I do not hate my wife I cannot be Chriſts diſciple. An excellent concluſion, a very ſound inference. I hope, notwithſtanding his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) that I may come to Chriſt without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to ſuch private meetings as theirs are: and I hope my wife may divert me from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, from danger, from their private meetings, and yet not divert me from Chriſt, or from his ordinances, ſo as to give me occaſion to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101327:48"/>hate her. Doth <hi>Tom Savery</hi> think that to be at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Raddons</hi> chamber in praying and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching up ſelf intereſts, and promoting dividing principles, is a waiting on God in his gallories? if it be ſo to him, 'tis not ſo to me; pray give liberty of conſcience to others, as well as take it your ſelves. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> hath well vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Tom Savery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I take no farther notice of his deſcant on my letter to him and his Church, or of <hi>Tom Saveries</hi> letter to me; a common eye ſees how frivolous his exceptions are.</p>
            <p>But now he comes with his Kill-cow in his 22. page.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold yet greater abominations</hi> (ſayes he) Well, what's the matter? He ſaith, that I fear at the workings of the ſpirit in thoſe mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and lamentings which God was pleaſed to beſtow upon his people upon that ſad day; And that I blaſphemouſly called it a hideous howling cry, and accounted ſo juſt a cenſure to be like the Popes bull, a beaſt, when it roars the loudeſt.</p>
            <p>For anſwer, I bleſſe God, I am not ignorant, how horrid a ſin it is to jeer at the workings of Gods ſpirit in the mournings, ſighs or groanes of his children; and 'tis not M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley,</hi> nor the Divel himſelf (the grand accuſer of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) can juſtly accuſe me for any ſuch thing. I can (I bleſſe God) appeal to the ſearcher of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101327:49"/>hearts, in the uprightneſſe of my heart, that I am free from any ſuch ſin, or the leaſt thought thereof; And I do not in the leaſt recant what I ſaid, I did ſay, and do ſay ſtill, that they made a hideous howling cry or noiſe; in ſo much that one of them fell down in a ſown, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited; and others told me, that they were fearfull to tarry longer among them, and truly I was and am ſerious, and doe not jeer: I think they might well make a hideous howling cry, when they were about ſuch hideous work; They were not about Gods work, I dare ſay, it was the Devils. They were perverting and miſapplying Gods Ordinance.</p>
            <p>What to curſe, and caſt out Gods ſervants to the Devil, unjuſtly denying them an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent hearing: and when they had no warrant from Gods revealed word, to pretend an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate word, an <hi>Enthuſiaſme</hi> or Revelation for it? what elſe meant your fictitious Parley between God and the Devil in your printed libell, telling your Church that the Devil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thoſe women to be given him by God, and that God bid your Church give them to the Devil, and bid the Devil take them, and torment them, repreſenting them as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſubjects of the Devils fury and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance by your unjuſt curſe, pray what meant your, <hi>take her Devil,</hi> was not this enough to make your members (if conſcientious, any of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101327:49"/>them) to make a hideous cry? yea to howl too, for fear that the Devil would have viſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to encourage you in ſuch a work, as (it is credibly reported) he hath ſince given you a viſit in your houſe. 'Tis well you have gotten an inſpiration, I am ſure you had no written word of God, applicable to this caſe; and therefore what if I compared it to the Popes Bull, I think it very near of kin: yours as juſt and Right as his, and no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And as for the copy of your prayer, It was taken by a man, who (whatever M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> ſayes to diſparage him) hath been &amp; is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by honeſt men to be honeſt and religious, ſuch as will not falſify any thing therein; But the truth is, 'tis ſuch a miſhapen piece that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Stucley</hi> is aſhamed to father it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his pag. 24. he brings in his compurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours: and who are they? his Church Officers and other complices in this unjuſt act; they are birds of a feather, they muſt witneſſe that it was not his prayer, and ſay they, ſomewhat was inſerted, and ſomewhat was omitted; but they ſet not down a word what this <hi>Somewhat</hi> was: a very fair teſtimonial, ask my fellows, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As for the ſtory of my wifes abuſing her Siſter, I have made a true report thereof in my obſervations on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> printed Sermon, to which I referre the Reader, aſſuring him that 'tis not all M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> ſhufling untruths
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101327:50"/>and evaſions can acquit him from unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and unworthineſſe in that buſineſs.</p>
            <p>And the like I ſay of his reflections in his letters: what I have averr'd touching it, is true; and 'tis ſufficiently verified by himſelf in his ſcurrilous Pamphlet againſt me and my wife, in which you ſee that practiſe exemplified to the life.</p>
            <p>And as for his charging me with neglect of fraternall correption in 18. Particulars in his 28. pag.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only give this ſhort anſwer, that it is a falſe charge; Liars need good memories.</p>
            <p>Reader caſt back thy eye, and peruſe my letter in my <hi>Narrative</hi> and ſee how many of theſe things I complained of, that concerned him and particular members of his Church; what was this but admonition, and what effect had it? 'twas clapt up and not communicated, leaſt it ſhould diſſatisfy the Church: a fine ſhift to ſtifle my complaints and hide them from the Church, and after charge me with neglect of fraternall correption.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> may alſo remember that I told him that I heard that the Church had ſent up a dangerous petition, and that it was ill reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And that he was ſo far from diſowning or diſliking it, that he wiſhed that he were in <hi>London,</hi> to preſent it with his own hands. And ſince he knows that I have ſent him ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101327:50"/>letters ſhewing him the particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the unrighteouſneſſe of his cenſure lay, and yet he moſt impudently denies all?</p>
            <p>I could go through all the eighteen particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and ſhew how I have diſcovered to the parties concerned, my diſſatisfaction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended them for their practiſe as occaſion did ſerve. But in regard moſt of theſe are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in my precedent ſheets, as I have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally met with them, and others of them will fall in to be ſpoken to in my anſwer to his 48. pretended lies, I do (for brevity ſake) wave them here, and ſhall proceed to his Catalogue of lies, to give brief anſwers to ſuch as are not already ſpoken to; as followeth.</p>
            <p>And as for his firſt pretended lie. That his Sermon contained many foul untruths and baſe reflections, who ſees it not? And that he printed it, what was it, but to ſpread falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports? I utterly deny that any perſon was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by me to write his Sermon or prayer, but after I heard what good ſtuff it was, I was willing to have it written out fair, that my ſelf and others might read it, and where is the lie in all this?</p>
            <p>To his ſecond ſuppoſed lie, I doe ſtill averre that my report in my <hi>Narrative</hi> of all tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions relating to my wifes excommunication is true. And for his pretended care or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to prevent this cenſure I know none, but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101327:51"/>only his deſires for my joyning in that cruel act were ſufficiently evidenced; but the Lord in mercy prevented it.</p>
            <p>To the third, I ſay ſtill, and that truely (and think the Reader is convinced) that there were never any crimes proved againſt M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parr</hi> or my wife deſerving ſuch a cenſure. If he can make any appeare, why doth he yet lie in his hole, and refuſe to come forth before the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to evince it, and anſwer what he hath done: he thinks his pen muſt plead for him, and he may print lies, <hi>Cum Privilegio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I utterly deny that I ever joyned in M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parrs</hi> ſuſpenſion; I was ſatisfied in her anſwer; and if ſhe were ſuſpended, it was unjuſtly done.</p>
            <p>To the fourth, I have anſwered before in my Book, and (I think) have ſufficiently evinced it to be an unrighteous cenſure: I ſhall ſay little more to that before I ſee M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> prove it to be righteous, which he can never do: he ſhuns the light, for my part I little thought that he and his Church ſhould ever have been ſo far left to themſelves, as to proceed ſo unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly.</p>
            <p>I did not deſire their forbearance of my wife upon any ſuch account, as he pretends; 'tis true, that I wiſhed them to forbear their vexings of her (almoſt daily) as they did, for fear leaſt ſhe, being big with child, might have miſcaried by reaſon of their continued vexations.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:101327:51"/>
            <p> To the fifth, I ſay, we were fixed as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Downs</hi> Church, as really as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther members of that Church, &amp; did receive the Sacrament there, and that without any ſuch conditions as he ſuppoſes: yet I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and was reſolved by an able Miniſter, that I might (notwithſtanding) ſit down with Gods people in any other congregation, as provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould order, or as occaſion was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
            <p>To the ſixth, I ſay we were not admitted of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church, untill almoſt a year after we had ſpoken our experiences; and for the difficulty of out admiſſion, if it had been either for ignorance or ſcandall, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten enough with us, and might in all that time have told us ſo much; But never a word of any ſuch thing till he had a mind to curſe my wife for deſerting him.</p>
            <p>To the ſeventh, I ſay Mr. <hi>Eveleigh</hi> one of the Church-officers, and others called the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which was brought into the Church to be debated <hi>(a Covenant)</hi> &amp; told me that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part thereof was aſſented unto, &amp; therefore if it be lies, you ſee who was the Authour, and that I did diſlike it I have already demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>To the eighth; I ſay, my wife did joyn to Mr. <hi>Downs</hi> Church, as in my <hi>Narrative</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and that which Mr. <hi>Stucley</hi> call's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition preceeding it, was only Mr. <hi>VVhit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hornes</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:101327:52"/>asking her the reaſons of her abſence from their Thurſdayes private meetings, when ſhe had been abſent not above three or four times, for which I think the reader is ſatisfied ſhe had ſome reaſon to abſtaine.</p>
            <p>To the 9. the traducing of Mr. <hi>Forde</hi> &amp; ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of honeſt godly people different from your principle, hath been too frequent among you, and the lie and ſlander returns on your ſelves.</p>
            <p>To the tenth, I ſay I have ſufficiently ſet forth, the occaſion, manner, and end of my wifes going to <hi>Honiton,</hi> which is the Truth, and will ſtand firme another day, when all Mr. <hi>Stucleys</hi> foiſted probabilites, will be found to be nothing but the ſcum of his malicious Calumniating ſpirit.</p>
            <p>To the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> I ſay I deny not that I had hopes to prevail with my wife to return to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church, as my <hi>Narrative</hi> ſhews, but when I had conſidered her grounds of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction, and their harſh proceedings in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to excommunication, I abſtained from their private meetings, eſpecially after that one of the honeſteſt of the confederacy had coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell'd me to pluck up my ſpirits; and hold the rains of Government ſtrict in my hands, and to forbid my wifes brothers, Siſters and friends to come near my houſe, and to turn away ſuch ſervants as would not be plyable to this work, and to take in others, and to bear a ſtiff hand
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101327:52"/>on my wife, and that then ſhe would go from me, and I ſhould not look after her; and that then ſhe would be weary and repent, and I ſhould receive her on mine own terms. I did preſently gueſſe from whom this counſell came, for asking the party when he was with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley,</hi> he anſwered he had been with him about two hours before, and would needs ingage me to go to Maſter <hi>Stucley;</hi> which I thought to have done, but my heart failed me, and I durſt not goe, fearing leaſt he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me to ſome ſuch wicked courſe as was propoſed. You ſee where to repair for good counſell how to order your wives.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth, hath neither head nor tail, I ſhall anſwer it when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> explaines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if it be then worth an anſwer.</p>
            <p>To the 14. I averre that he opened the letter which M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parr</hi> and my wife ſent, and moſt falſly and unfaithfully told the Church, that it had more of deſigne then humility in it. If it had any deſigne, it was to prevent his and his Churches harſh and heady running into a miſchievous act: and if it be (as he ſayes) that none of the Church ſaw it, I ſay, the worſe, the more unfaithfull, and inexcuſable was M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> for that: it was ſent, and directed to be communicated to the Church, and he would not ſhew it them, nor ask counſel of any in ſo waighty a buſineſſe, but lead his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101327:53"/>Churchhead long into ſin. The letter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all, but he conceales it: and did he not therein ſhew himſelf more a lord and Maſter, then a Steward and diſpencer of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? If this be his faithfulneſſe, let me never be under ſuch a faithfull Shepheard.</p>
            <p>To the 15. To this I have anſwered already, I only adde, that <hi>Ratcliff</hi> that noted Mr. <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleys</hi> prayer, and others alſo that heard it, do a verre it to be his prayer, ſuch a one as it was.</p>
            <p>To the 16. I anſwer I have examined more narrowly this particular and find, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Malls</hi> doctrine was, that there is great reaſon, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture reaſon, when in ſevering the precious from the vile, the Church ſhould renew their covenant: and he applied it to the buſineſſe of excommunication then acted, and preſſed the renewing of their covenant. Pray where is the great difference from what I have ſet down in my <hi>Narrative</hi> that denominates it to be a lye? And as for his poſture, whether he ſate down or ſtood up, 'its not much materiall. If I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in that, I am ſure I am right in all the reſt.</p>
            <p>To the 17. I ſuppoſe M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parr</hi> is anſwering for her ſelfe: and as for my wife I ſay again, ſhe found faults and ſaw cauſe enough to leave them, and did deſert them before ſhe was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed for neglecting their private meetings</p>
            <p>To the 18. I anſwer, that if you did not look on other Churches as <hi>Babyloniſh,</hi> &amp;c. Pray tell
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101327:53"/>me how do your words and opinions agree? pray what meaneth your cry? come out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> what meaneth the ſaying of one of your officers, to one that was going to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Bartlets</hi> Church <hi>(viz.)</hi> what will you never come out of <hi>Babylon?</hi> and what meant that <hi>Independent</hi> Book, One blow more to <hi>Babylon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Nineteenth I anſwer, here M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cley</hi> ſhifts, and pretends he underſtood not my meaning; and that he meant not the Churches in <hi>Exon,</hi> when all this while his conſcience tells him, that I was meaning and ſpeaking to him of the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>Exon,</hi> could he think I was ſpeaking of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating in Spaine or France in their maſſe. I remember well, he ſpake theſe words to me, without intermſſion; Can you (ſayd he) partake where there are Drunkards? can you partake where there are liars? can you partake of the Table of the Lord, and the Table of Divells? and as for the argument you recite out of my letter; of your acknowledging the Churches in <hi>'Exon</hi> to be true Churches. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is well knowen, with how much adoe he ſhewed them as much; Note, this was ſpoken by him above two months before he owned the Churches here to be Churches of Chriſt: the aſſociated Miniſters in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> know enough of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> mind.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101327:54"/>About owning other Churches I need ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>To the twentiteh, I ſay, let the judicious Reader judge, What other conſtruction can be made of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> citing of <hi>Pro.</hi> 5.8.9, and Tit. 2.5. and his applying <hi>Doctor Taylors</hi> Expoſition thereupon to my wife, then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate and beget in the Reader a ſuſpition of my Wifes chaſtity? and by ſpreading his falſe and ſcurrilous Pamphlets into <hi>Dorſet, Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi> and other places in the weſt to induce the people to believe thoſe honeſt women to be as vile and notorious as is imaginable.</p>
            <p>To the 21.<hi rend="sup">th</hi> there needs no anſwer, but the experience of the people of this place; let them judge if I lye in this.</p>
            <p>To the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> I anſwer 'tis well known that my wife was of Mr. <hi>Downes</hi> congregation, and received the Sacrament there before ſhe joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucleys</hi> Church: and for M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parr</hi> ſhe attended on the other Miniſters. And therefore I think owned them: ſure there were no others in <hi>Exon</hi> that ſhe owned, till M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> came.</p>
            <p>To the 23<hi rend="sup">th</hi> imputed lye, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley,</hi> Pray be not angry, I muſt tell you againe, that your ſaying that my wife is a lawleſſe woman, that knowes no ſubjection, is a moſt notorious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying her indeed, and to perſiſt in it as you doe, in ſaying that ſhe hath taken the power of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101327:54"/>rule out of my hands (in the particulars you there inſtance) is a bold untruth. I am ſorry and aſhamed to ſee you ſo impudent in aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch apparent falſehoods. Pray tell me, did I ever complaine to you of my wifes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience? what tatling goſſop was it from whom you had this tale? did ſhe not tell you, 'twas not I, but my wife that put the girts into the pot? why had you not printed that alſo, to prove my wifes taking the government out of my hands? well, this looks but like a ſneaking trick, to pry and peep into other folkes cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boards and kitchens to diſcover their hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-affaires; but I am ſure all is but a falſe goſſopps tale at beſt.</p>
            <p>As for the 24.25.26. pretended lyes, I referr the reader to my anſwer to the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
            <p>To the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I have anſwered already, and begg'd them mercy for my miſtake, if I did ſo farr forget my ſelf as to ſay that they were the honeſteſt people that ever I came amongſt: I have recanted that errour.</p>
            <p>For his deniall of ſlurring M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rutherford</hi> in calling him the Champion of Presbytery, I ſhall referr it to the judgement of the Reader, that conſiders how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> eſteems of the Presbyterians, and what a ſtickler he is againſt that way.</p>
            <p>To the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I have ſufficiently ſpoken, and ſhewed his baſe abuſe of, and blind procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101327:55"/>againſt my wife, and challenged him to a publique debate of it, which he refuſeth; I am ſure he can never prove what he ſayes in his pamphlet, unleſſe he can get ſome Knights of the Poſt to be his witneſſes.</p>
            <p>To the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I tell M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> that I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver burthened with old Dame, but once when he told me a lye upon her, and then I was ſo zealous as to call her Naughty woman, but my mouth was never ſo foul as to call her whore, as he ſuggeſts. Had I done ſo, I would have begg'd her mercy, for I believe, ſhe is as truly honeſt as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> himſelf. But had ſhe been ſuch as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> reports, yet why might not my wife go with her, with leſſe ignominy then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> may keep ſuch a one for a Nurſe in his houſe conſtantly for a year and more. As for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Mongwell, he hath given it under his hand that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> hath ſlandred both him, and her in his falſe reports.</p>
            <p>To the 32. 'tis not worth an anſwer, yet I ſay, I might well avouch the tenderneſſe and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my wife, which I had ever found, though his and his Churches dealings occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a ſudden heat or diſcontent for once.</p>
            <p>To the 33 and 34. I ſay M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Parr</hi> was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned by the Elder of their Church for going to hear M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Forde,</hi> to the neglect of their owne officers, &amp; was told that ſhe ſhould be called to account for it, I have ſpoken to this already,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101327:55"/>and therefore ſhall onely ask this queſtion, if ſhe had been ſo guilty of lyes and deviſions as they charge her to be, why were thoſe things let alone, ſome of them for two years and more, and then they muſt prove ſo mortall? why did they let her lye ſo long in her ſin? but I doubt not ſhe will ſufficiently clear her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, therefore I forbear.</p>
            <p>To this 35. I ſay M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> repeats falſe. Reader, look into my Narrative, I do not there ſay that he never reproved my wife in four years; but that he never reproved her in that tyme for her neglect of admonition of others.</p>
            <p>To the 36. 37. 38. 39. &amp; 40. pretended lyes, all which do concern the ſtory of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between my wife and her Siſter in Law, I anſwer that what I have ſet downe in my Narrative relating to that buſineſſe is the very truth; and yet obſerve how confidently this bold man ſpeaks paſſages in that buſineſſe, as if he had been preſent and privy to every thing ſpoken or done about it, when in the meane time, he prints all this meerly upon relation and hearſay, and hath no better authority for it then if he had taken it out of Eſops fables.</p>
            <p>To the 41.42. I anſwer that my wife and her ſiſter were reconciled friends; and feaſted, talked, journied, and went to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together many times, and how durſt this
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101327:56"/>paſtor ſuffer them, if he knew them to be enemies all this while.</p>
            <p>To the 43. Imputation; I confeſſe I was in a miſtake, but noe wilfull one. I ſaid it was near three years when as it was not above a year and half: this was a miſtake onely in point of time which I have now rectified, but I am ſure 'twas long enough, the differences were dead and buried by an amicable compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stucley</hi> muſt rake up any thing to make a ſtinking ſtir withall.</p>
            <p>To the 44. <hi>I</hi> ſhall onely bid my adverſary repeat right: my words are; they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to cenſure her for, before ſhe left them; And this is the Truth. <hi>I</hi> have and doe challenge him to bring forth any crime that deſerved Church cenſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe deſerted them: as for her forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their private meetings, which Maſter <hi>Stucley</hi> calls Church meetings, I think the Reader is convinced, She had ſufficient cauſe.</p>
            <p>To the 45. I ſay, that I lament his impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: 'tis knowen to the whole Citty that 'tis their principle, and practice to deny their members to communicate in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with other Churches. <hi>I</hi> can prove that ſome were refuſed by him, onely becauſe they would not be confined to his Church, and he hath denied it me as <hi>I</hi> have already
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101327:56"/>ſhown, can ye partake of the Table of the Lord, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To this 46. I ſhall onely wiſh Mr. <hi>Stucley</hi> to be as good as his word, I make noe queſtion but you have heard how your member Mr. <hi>Robert Spragne</hi> was convicted for two lies againſt the chamber of <hi>Exeter:</hi> I fear they had another originall, and his was but the ſecond edition, however they were publick offences, and therefore pray inſtruct him to go to the chamber and acknowledge his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in ſpreading two lies againſt them, that they may forgive him, or elſe according to your doctrine, he will be in a ſad caſe, for you told me lately, that we ought not to forgive, unleſſe the offending party ask us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe.</p>
            <p>To the 47. for anſwer I referre the Reader to my anſwer to his 18th pretended lye, I onely demand whether you would grant that there was any other Church of Chriſt in <hi>Exeter,</hi> till about the beginning of <hi>April</hi> laſt, did you not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time ſtile your ſelves (the) Church of Chriſt in <hi>Exeter?</hi> pray what means your calling thoſe of your own Church and noe others, Brother and Siſter by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction? what means that Tenent of ſome (if not all) of you, that you muſt love thoſe of your own fellowſhip above any other of Gods people, as a man loves his wife above other women? and why ſhould not Mr. <hi>Savery</hi> grant Mr. <hi>Forde</hi> the Miniſter, to be one of the viſible Church of Chriſt, when he was ſo hardly preſt to it?</p>
            <p>To the laſt I ſhall onely ſay, That as for Mr. <hi>Malls</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, I referre it to the Reader to judge by his reaſons that are extant in his Book; And if any other conſtruction (then mine) can be made thereof I ſhall be well content: for the Truth is, I believe the poore man was meerly drawn in.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, Reader doe but reflect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the whole ſtory and ſtate of the buſineſſe laid before thee, and then judge impartially of Mr. <hi>Stucley</hi> and his Churches proceedings, and at whoſe doore all the lies and foul practices muſt be laid. I profeſſe 'tis farre from me to take any content to imbroile in differences; or to make diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of others nakedneſſe, could I avoid it, as all that know me can bear me record: but in this caſe, I may truly ſay, he hath compelled me, 'tis noe time for truth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency to ſeek out corners, and to hold 'its peace, when
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101327:57"/>falſhood and upſtart <hi>Novelliſme</hi> is ſo clamorous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Stucley,</hi> (you ſee) hath declined a hearing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied ſatisfaction to the unſatisfied, and playes the part of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Commander, who having ill ſtewarded the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the Common wealth, ſtudied not ſo much how to give an account, as not to give any account at all, which hath neceſſitated me to this work.</p>
            <p>Pardon me (right courteous Reader) If I have been a little exaſperated by Mr. <hi>Stucleys</hi> intemperate dealing, and if I have uttered ought, more fit for him to hear, then me to ſpeak, It being almoſt impoſſible for any man that is converſant in his writings, but to contract ſomewhat of his eloquence: conſider the caſe in hand, and it is ſuch as will even put words into the mouth of <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury calles on me to ſpeake more loud and largely in mine own cauſe, but modeſty bids me forbear. My deſigne is not to derogate from him, but (if poſſible) to convince him and to ſatisfie others, truely honeſt and conſcientious. I deny not his perſonall abilities, yet (without preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption) dare appeale and ſay, he hath neither ſhown that ſoundneſſe of judgement, that is to be reverenced in ſome, nor that meekneſſe of ſpirit that is required in all: my prayer therefore is, that God will give him theſe and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers graces that may make him more inſtrumentall for his glory and the good of his Church.</p>
